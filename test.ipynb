UHI mitigation \\nstrategies have been investigated and utilized extensively within cities by \\nthe provision of green, blue or gray infrastructures. However, urban land is \\nprecious and limited for these interventions, making it challenging to address \\nthis issue. Neighboring rural land cover may serve as a cooling source and have \\na great potential to mitigate UHI through processes such as heat absorption \\nand circulation. This study aims to address the following questions: (1) what is \\nthe location of neighboring rural land cover to effectively mitigate UHI for the \\nentire city and (2) what are the key parameters of the landscape. We investigated \\nthe quantitative and qualitative relationships between rural land cover and \\nUHI, drawing on geographical and environmental data from 30 Chinese cities \\nbetween 2000 and 2020. We found that the rural land cover extending outward \\nfrom the urban boundary, approximately half of the equivalent diameter of \\ncity, had the most pronounced impact on UHI mitigation. The number and \\nadjacency of landscape patches (a patch is a homogeneous and nonlinear basic \\nunit of a landscape pattern, distinct from its surroundings) emerged as two \\nkey factors in mitigating UHI, with their individual potential to reduce UHI by \\nup to 0.5\\u2009°C. The proposed recommendations were to avoid fragmentation \\nand enhance shape complexity and distribution uniformity of patches. This \\nwork opens new avenues for addressing high-temperature urban catastrophes \\nfrom a rural perspective, which may also promote coordinated development \\nbetween urban and rural areas.\\nCities are the cradle of human civilization, ensuring human pro -\\ngress, scientific innovations and economic advancements. Despite \\nthe constructive development activities within cities, they have \\nalso created and intensified certain environmental challenges 1,2.  \\nThe Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect causing urban overheating is a \\nprominent example of these concerns resulting from rising urbaniza-\\ntion and anthropogenic activities3,4. It has seriously endangered human \\nlives, well-being and ecosystems, ultimately leading to economic \\nconsequences 5. In July 2023, the world experienced the hottest  \\n month on record, with widespread heatwaves across many countries6. \\nMoreover, temperature extremes on land will increase even faster com-\\npared to the increase of global mean temperature (land and ocean) \\ndue to climate change from human activities 4. Hence, holistically  \\nformulating an effective adaptation and mitigation strategy for  \\nthe UHI effect has become a focal issue for sustainable urban  \\ndevelopment7,8.\\nReceived: 2 December 2023\\nAccepted: 17 June 2024\\nPublished online: 5 July 2024\\n Check for updates\\n1School of Architecture, Southeast University, Nanjing, China. 2Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center of Urban Heat and Pollution Control, \\nSoutheast University, Nanjing, China. 3Global Centre for Clean Air Research, School of Sustainability, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of \\nEngineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Surrey, UK. 4Institute for Sustainability, University of Surrey, Surrey, UK. 5Energy and Environment \\nGroup, Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. \\u2009e-mail: shijie_cao@seu.edu.cn',\n",

UL1 represented \\nthe area of urban center, whereas UL2–5 gradually expanded outwards \\n(i\\u2009=\\u20095 corresponding to the urban boundary area), as shown in Fig. 2. The \\nurban boundary was taken as the baseline and was extended outwards \\nto obtain four rings, that is, rural ladders RLj (j\\u2009=\\u20091–4), of different radii. \\nThe inner boundary of each RL was the urban boundary. The average \\nequivalent diameter of the selected cities was 22\\u2009km. Rural land cover \\nwas classified into five types: woodland, cropland, impervious surface, \\nwater body and grassland (grassland was not analyzed independently; \\nexplanation in Methods).\\nFigure 1a shows that NRLC (considering the totality of five types) \\ncan achieve cooling for all ULs. Specially, NRLC had the largest explana-\\ntion degree of nearly 30% on the surface UHII variance in UL1, due to the \\neffect of heat island circulation and convection (Supplementary Infor-\\nmation B). The NRLC in RL3, RL2 and RL4 had the highest explanation \\ndegree on the surface UHII variance in UL1,2,5, UL4 and UL3, respectively. \\nGiven that NRLC in RL3 still had the second largest explanation degree \\nto the surface UHII variance in UL3,4, the NRLC in RL3 potentially had the \\ngreatest UHI mitigation capacity for the entire urban area compared \\nwith RL\\n1,2,4.\\nFigure 1b–e shows that impervious surfaces had the most sig -\\nnificant influence on surface UHII, followed by cropland, and finally \\nwoodland and water body. The explanation degree of impervious \\nsurface in RL 3 and RL4 to surface UHII variance was compared, with \\nthe small difference being within 0.01. The UHI mitigation capacity of \\nimpervious surface in RL3 and RL4 was greater than that in RL1 and RL2. \\nCropland and woodland in RL 1 presented a markedly lower explana-\\ntion degree to UHI variance compared with other RLs. Cropland in RL3 \\nexplained the greatest degree of the UHI variance in UL3,5 and exhibited \\na slightly lower explanation degree compared with the maximum \\ndegree in UL1,2,4 (that is, difference of 0.015, 0.005, 0.005 for UL1, UL2 \\nand UL4, respectively). Water body in RL2 explained the UHI variations \\nof all ULs to a higher extent than other RLs. Supplementary Fig. A2 \\nshows the corresponding combinations ULi–RLj, that is, NRLC or land \\ncover types in RLj have the largest explanation degree of surface UHII \\nvariance in ULi compared with other RLs. Taking NRLC as an example, \\nthe corresponding combinations were UL 1–RL3, UL2–RL3, UL3–RL4, \\nUL4–RL2, UL5–RL3.\\nKey parameters of rural land cover for UHI mitigation\\nThis section aimed to rank the landscape-level parameters (LLPs, used \\nfor NRLC) with correlations to the UHI mitigation. These parameters \\nwere determined through the calculation of SHapley Additive exPla-\\nnations (SHAP) values and Pearson correlation analyses. In the previ-\\nous section, the corresponding RL for each UL (rural land cover in RL \\nexplained most of the surface UHII variance in UL) was obtained. On the \\nbasis of it, Fig. 3 illustrates the ranking of the SHAP values for the LLPs \\nin rural regions, which reflects the capability to mitigate the surface \\nUHII of the corresponded urban areas (that is, ULi, i\\u2009=\\u20091–5). The higher \\nthe SHAP value, the better the UHI mitigation. It can be noted that AI \\n(aggregation index), COHESION (patch cohesion index), PR (patch rich-\\nness) and DIVISION (Landscape Division Index) were almost at the top \\nof the SHAP rankings. T o sum up, the key LLPs for different correspond-\\ning combinations on UHI mitigation were: UL1–RL3 (PR, DIVISION, NP \\n(number of patches)); UL2–RL3 (AI, IJI (interspersion & juxtaposition \\nindex), PR, NP); UL3–RL4 (PR, LSI (landscape shape index), COHESION, \\nNP, IJI); UL4–RL2 (LSI, COHESION, IJI, PR); and UL5–RL3 (COHESION, \\nLSI, PR, NP) (more details can be found in Supplementary Table A1).\\nSupplementary Figs. A3 and A4 and Supplementary Table A1 show \\nthe extraction process and final results regarding the key parameters \\nof four land cover types. The key parameters of woodland were mainly \\nNP, IJI and AI. The key parameters of cropland were mainly CIRCLE_AM \\n(circle index distribution) and IJI. The key parameters of impervious \\nsurface were mainly IJI, SPLIT (Splitting Index) and CIRCLE_AM. The \\nkey parameters for water body were mainly IJI, PD (patch density), CA \\n(total (class) area), SHAPE_AM (shape index distribution) and CLUMPY \\n(clumpiness index).\\nImpact of key parameters of rural land cover on UHI\\nThis section aimed to elaborate the individual impact of the key \\nLLPs on UHII for the aforementioned combinations (that is, UL1–RL3,  \\nUL2–RL3, UL3–RL4, UL4–RL2 and UL5–RL3), as presented in Fig. 4. Most \\nof the key landscape parameters and the surface UHII were close to a \\nsimple monotonic relationship. For instance, taking the urban region \\nUL1 (the hottest region) as an example (that is, UL1–RL3; Fig. 4a): (1) \\nthe value of surface UHII decreased as PR increased (PR, namely patch \\nrichness, indicates the total number of land cover types); (2) the value \\nof surface UHII decreased as DIVISION increased (DIVISION, that is, \\nlandscape division index, indicates the probability that two randomly \\nchosen pixels in the landscape are not situated in the same patch) and \\n(3) the value of surface UHII decreased as NP decreased.\\nFigure 4a–e columns elaborate that some key LLPs belonged to \\nmore than one UL and had a similar relationship with the surface UHII \\nof different ULs. For example, the surface UHII at UL 1,2,3,5 decreased \\nUL 1 –RL 3 UL 2 –RL 3 UL 3 –RL 4 UL 5 –RL 3UL 4 –RL 2\\nSHEI 4\\n12\\n3\\n1\\n6\\n8\\n11\\n7\\n10\\n2\\n5\\n13\\n9\\n12\\n13\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n3\\n11\\n10\\n2\\n1\\n11\\n13\\n9\\n1\\n7\\n4\\n2\\n5\\n8\\n6\\n12\\n3\\n10\\n9\\n13\\n12\\n7\\n11\\n4\\n1\\n2\\n6\\n3\\n8\\n5\\n10\\n11\\n13\\n6\\n5\\n7\\n9\\n3\\n4\\n12\\n2\\n10\\n1\\n8\\nSPLIT\\nSHDI\\nPR\\nPLADJ\\nNP\\nLSI\\nLPI\\nIJI\\nDIVISION\\nCONTAG\\nCOHESION\\nAI Aggregation index\\nShannon's evenness index\\nLLP\\nShannon's diversity index\\nPatch richness\\nSplitting index\\nCombination\\nLandscape division index\\nLLP abbreviation\\nPatch cohesion index\\nInterspersion and juxtaposition index\\nPercentage of like adjacencies\\nContagion\\nLandscape shape index\\nLargest patch index\\nNumber of patches\\n13\\n1\\nWeak\\nStrong\\n3\\n4\\n2\\n10\\n12\\n9\\n5\\n11\\n7\\n8\\n6\\nSHAP ranking\\nFig. 3 | SHAP ranking of LLPs for different combinations of RL and UL.

This finding provided an opportunity to achieve \\neffective cooling of a large part of the urban area through simple regula-\\ntion of the same landscape parameters. The influencing pattern of key \\nparameters, which belong to more than or equal to three ULs and having \\nthe same influence pattern on different ULs, were recommended to be \\nused for generating key strategies on UHI mitigation. The other key \\nLLPs, which can only mitigate surface UHII of a particular UL or have \\ndifferent influencing mechanisms on the surface UHII of different ULs, \\nwere used for generating supplementary strategies for localized area \\nof refined UHI mitigation. As shown in Fig. 5, the influence patterns of \\nNP, IJI, LSI and COHESION were considered in key strategies to mitigate \\nUHI, that is, (1) decreasing the number of patches (NP); (2) decreas -\\ning the even distribution of adjacencies among patch types (IJI); (3) \\navoiding square patch shapes (LSI) and (4) increasing the connected-\\nness of the patches (COHESION).

The influencing pattern of CIRCLE_AM and IJI for cropland; \\nCIRCLE_AM, SPLIT and IJI for impervious surface; and NP, CA, CLUMPY , \\nSHAPE_AM and IJI for water body were also selected in main strategies. \\nAll the main strategies are summarized in Table 1.\\nDiscussion\\nThe rural regions, with their rich natural land cover and simpler func-\\ntional patterns, hold great potential for mitigating UHI24. This study \\naims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating both quantitative \\nand qualitative influence of NRLC on UHI mitigation in China from \\n2000 to 2020, as shown in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2. Results indicate \\nthat NRLC can possess the capacity to mitigate UHI for entire cities. \\nSpecifically, we discover that NRLC can contribute to urban cooling, \\nwith the most pronounced impact occurring within a 10–15\\u2009km radius \\nfrom the urban boundary, which is closely interacted with the urban \\narea. It further suggests that NRLC within this range can contribute \\nup to 30% to the reduction of UHII in urban centers. The richness and \\ndensity of landscape patches emerge as key factors in mitigating UHI, \\nwith the potential to reduce UHI by 0.5\\u2009°C through the modulation of \\nkey parameters. More suggestions are summarized in Table 1.\\nWhy do we need rural land cover types at specific locations to \\nmitigate UHI? We explain this through urban physics, leveraging the \\nconcept of heat island circulation (Supplementary Information B) and \\nconvection. Heat circulation holds paramount importance in urban \\nventilation and the exchange of energy between urban and rural envi-\\nronments. In this dynamic circulation process, air is warmed up within \\nurban areas due to the effect of buoyancy force, creating a low-pressure \\nzone near the ground. Subsequently the heated air will be transported \\nto the rural regions via convection and diffusion, drawing cooler air \\nfrom rural areas to continuously replenish the urban core. Our study \\nreveals that RL 3 land cover can exert the most significant effect on \\nUHI, with its circular radius encompassing a range of 10–15\\u2009km, which \\nis approximately half of the city’s equivalent diameter, similar to the \\nfinding from Fan et al.26\\nDuring the heat circulation cycles between different ladders  \\n(ULi and RLj), the heat is absorbed by the rural landscapes at a different \\nextent depending on the types and locations. Hence, well-designed \\nlandscape patches (including features such as the richness and density) \\nshould be promoted to realize self-cooling in rural regions.\\nThe complexity and diversity of urban characteristics, including \\nshape, development level, geographical location and climatic condi-\\ntions, pose potential risks of introducing significantly deviated find-\\nings in this study. T o address it, our research focuses exclusively on \\nsingle-centered cities exceeding 200\\u2009km2, primarily characterized by \\nplains interspersed with scattered terraces, hills and low mountains. \\nThis approach helps to reduce the impact of the cities’ shapes and \\ngeographical features under investigation. Furthermore, cities are \\ncategorized into five concentric rings (ULi) based on their varying urban \\ndevelopment intensities (UDI). This stratification enables a differen-\\ntiated analysis of the impact of rural land cover on UHI effect across \\ndifferent urban development intensities. By doing so, we successfully \\ngroup cities based on their urban development levels, thereby limiting \\nand quantifying the influence of urban development on our findings. \\nT o validate the influence of climate, cities are grouped according to \\ntheir climatic zones, and separate analyses are conducted. The mecha-\\nnisms of rural land cover in UHI mitigation have differences between \\nvarious climate zones. However, a significant impact of climate is not \\nobserved from the results.

Additionally, the majority of mitigation strategies identified in \\nChina are transferrable to different climate zones (Supplementary \\nInformation C). Consequently, our findings still have relatively high \\ngeneralizability and applicability in different cities. In the future, this \\nstudy holds promise in offering valuable methodological and strategic \\nguidance for refinement studies at the city scale and the development \\nof context-specific policy formulations.\\nThe heat island circulation can cross the physical urban bound -\\naries to facilitate heat exchange between cities and rural areas to \\nmitigate UHI. However, at the same time, due to the interaction and \\ncollision of energy and heat between cities and rural areas, it may lead \\nto a large amount of pollutants flowing back into the city with the heat \\nisland circulation, causing pollution to the urban ecosystem. The local \\nmicrocirculation between urban, suburban and urban–rural (buffer \\nzone) areas can be improved by rationalizing the landscape patches \\nof suburban and rural areas to provide spaces for heat exchange and \\npollutant filtration and sinking and to avoid pollutant refluxes. This \\nstudy shows that different types and locations of rural landscapes may \\nmitigate UHI to different degrees due to the different temperature \\ngradients of the thermal cycles.\\nT o sum up, rather than perceiving urbanization as an undesirable \\ntrend that opposes sustainable urban development, it is more construc-\\ntive to embrace it as a continuous process. Unlike the intricate process \\nof balancing urban development with sustainability, the regulation \\nof rural land cover would yield numerous co-benefits for both urban \\nand rural areas, including offering a nature-based solution without \\nencroaching on urban land 3, preserving rural landscape, boosting \\nrural economy, assisting in mitigating the UHI and supporting ongoing \\nurban prosperity and sustainability.\\nMethods\\nThis study aims to explore the impacts of neighboring rural land cover \\n(locations and landscape types) on urban heat island (UHI) mitigation. \\nThe method logic contains three main scenarios: (1) investigating the \\ninfluence of rural land cover in different locations on UHI at the urban \\nscale; (2) extracting the key rural landscape parameters on UHI mitiga-\\ntion and (3) identifying the impact of individual key landscape param-\\neters on UHI and proposing key mitigation strategies. The applied \\nresearch framework is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. First, 30 Chinese \\ncities are selected as case studies. The data of the UHI intensity (UHII) \\nand rural land cover for these cities are collected. Second, urban areas \\nare divided into urban ladders (UL i) based on UDI 27, and rural areas \\nare divided into Rural Ladders (RLj) with different distances from the \\nurban boundary28. The UHII values of different ULi are calculated and \\nthe land cover types of different RLj are categorized. Third, regression \\nmodels are used to analyze the impact of different rural land cover from \\nvarying distances to the urban boundary 29. Then, SHapley Additive \\nexPlanations (SHAP) is employed to rank the key landscape parameters \\nof rural land cover, including landscape-level parameters (LLPs) and \\nlandscape-class parameters (LCPs)30. Finally, accumulated local effects \\n(ALE) plots are used to reveal the impact of individual key landscape \\nparameters on UHII31.\\nCase studies\\nOn the basis of the China Urban Statistical Yearbook 2020 ( http://\\nwww.stats.gov.cn), 30 monocentric cities in China are selected with an \\nurban area of more than 200\\u2009km2 for investigation32. Documents have \\nreported that the urban shape substantially influences the UHI; mono-\\ncentric cities are more likely to experience the severe UHI phenomena33. \\nAs shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, except Urumqi, all the cities are evenly \\ndistributed in China’s monsoon climate zone, representing a high level \\nof urbanization. The landform characteristics of the sample cities \\ncan basically be categorized as dominated by plains, with scattered \\nterraces, hills and low mountains in the city. Climatic differences in \\ndifferent regions of the country have negligible effects on the results, \\nwith sufficient data demonstrated in Supplementary Information C.\\nData collection of UHII and rural land cover\\nLand cover data for 2000, 2005 and 2010 are obtained through Land-\\nsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) and for 2015 and 2020 through Landsat \\n8 OLI (Operational Land Imager). According to the common refer -\\nence system of remote sensing monitoring in China (National Land \\nUse/Cover Classification System for Remote Sensing Monitoring), \\nthe rural land cover was divided into five types: impervious surface, \\nwoodland, grassland, cropland and water body 34. Neighboring rural \\nland cover (NRLC) includes the totality of all land cover, that is, imper-\\nvious surface, woodland, grassland, cropland and water body. When \\nanalyzing landscape types independently, only four land cover types \\n(impervious surface, woodland, cropland and water body) are chosen \\nand grassland is excluded. Grassland has limited latent heat and low \\nheat absorption efficiency 35,36 and is not a common land cover type \\nin rural area neighboring cities of China. The training sample points \\nare equally distributed throughout the sample region obtained from \\nhigh-resolution photos in Google Earth Pro.

LST is considered to be strongly con-\\nnected to near-ground temperature and is commonly employed to \\ninvestigate the geographic and temporal features of the UHI impact38. \\nThe LST dataset for the selected cities incorporates synthetic tem -\\nperature data from MOD11A1 V6.1/LST_Day_1km in July and August. \\nDue to its wide bandwidth, this dataset is well suited to regional-scale \\ncross-sectional data analysis and modeling. Previous research has \\ndemonstrated the reliability of MODIS LST results, with errors typically \\nwithin 1\\u2009K (ref. 39). The monthly average of the daily LST values is used \\nto calculate the average summer LST for the selected cities in 2000, \\n2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020.\\nThis study selects a reference line obtained by offsetting 20\\u2009km \\nfrom the urban boundary as the baseline to calculate the surface UHII40. \\nA ring equal to the urban area is obtained. The LST of this ring is con-\\nsidered to be unaffected by the UHI footprint and used to calculate the \\nsurface UHI. In this approach, the non-urban area used for calculating \\nthe surface UHII does not overlap with the RL area, to minimize the \\nimpact of UHII variation resulting from the temperature change of RLj.\\nsurfaceUHIIULi = LSTULi −LSTrural\\n(i= 1,2,3,4,5)\\n(1)\\nwhere surfaceUHIIULi is the surface UHII of ULi in °C; LSTULi is the average \\nLST for ULi in June to August, °C; and LSTrural is the average LST of the \\nring from June to August, °C.\\nDemarcation of ULi and RLj\\nT o investigate the impact of rural land cover on UHI mitigation of dif-\\nferent urban regions (at a city scale), both urban and rural areas are \\ndemarcated for the sake of cross analysis. The cities are divided into \\nfive ULi and the selected rural areas are divided into four RLj.\\nThe urban development intensity indicator (UDIi), which typically \\nexhibits a linear correlation with UHI41, is used for the division of urban \\nareas. Different ULi correspond to different UDIi with certain intervals. \\nEach city is subdivided into five ULi to maximize the segmentation of \\nthe metropolitan area and prevent the ULi from becoming excessively \\nsmall and fragmented42. There are significant differences in surface \\nUHII between the different UL i shown in Supplementary Table A4. \\nThe city clustering algorithm (CCA) is utilized in this study to define \\ncity boundaries 43. Initially, a city map with a resolution of 3,000\\u2009m \\nis generated using an UDI threshold higher than 25% (ref. 44 ). UDI \\nis calculated as the proportion of total number of impervious grids \\nwithin each 3,000\\u2009×\\u20093,000\\u2009m pane 45, as shown in equation ( 2). Sub-\\nsequently, the urban area is identified using CCA with a clustering \\nparameter of 3,000\\u2009m, corresponding to the spatial resolution of the \\ninitial urban map45. Therefore, two pixels in the city maps previously \\nprocessed through UDI with a distance between pixel centers not \\nexceeding 3,000\\u2009m (clustering parameter of CCA) is assigned to the \\nsame city. Then, the complete shape of an urban area is obtained and \\nthe periphery of the urban area is extracted as the urban boundary. \\nFinally, UDI intervals within the urban area are further subdivided \\nto better represent the changes in UHI along the UDI. With an UDI \\ninterval of 15%, five UL\\ni of UL 1(UDI\\u2009=\\u200985–100%, UL 2(UDI\\u2009=\\u200970–85%), \\nUL3(UDI\\u2009=\\u200955–70%), UL4(UDI\\u2009=\\u200940–55%) and UL5(UDI\\u2009=\\u200925–40%), were \\nderived, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\\nUDIi =\\nSImpervioussurface,i\\nSi\\n×100%, (2)\\nwhere i denotes the ith image element on the raster map; UHIi denotes \\nthe Urban Development Intensity value of the ith image element; S i \\ndenotes the total area of the i th image element; and S Impervious surface, i  \\ndenotes the area of imperviousness in the ith image element.\\nThe RLj outside the urban area is delineated to ascertain the extent \\nof rural land cover that can exert the most significant impact on the UHI. \\nIn previous studies, the widely adopted approach for determining RLj \\nradius is to make the RLj area equal to the urban area46 or to employ a \\nuniform RLj radius of 5\\u2009km or 10\\u2009km (refs. 47,48). However, when the \\nRLj radius is too small, for instance, less than 1\\u2009km, it becomes chal -\\nlenging to reflect the true rural LST and there is also likelihood of it \\nbeing influenced by the UHI footprint 49. Therefore, in this study, we \\nadopt a varying RLj radius methodology50. On the basis of the selection \\nof the rural region in most UHI mitigation studies and the distances \\nbetween urban boundaries of sample cities (approximately 40\\u2009km). We \\ntentatively establish a maximum study area of 20\\u2009km from the urban \\nboundaries for rural land cover. The rural area within this boundary is \\nalso in close proximity to the metropolitan area. The width of the RL\\nj \\nradius, denoted as D, is determined to change by one level at a distance \\nof 5\\u2009km. This choice aligns with the 900-m resolution of rural land \\ncover, and the observed land cover changes between different RLj are \\nsignificant. Thus, the urban boundary is offset outward by four RL j, \\neach with varying ring widths. As shown in Fig. 1 , the minimum and \\nmaximum radii for these RLj are set as 2.5\\u2009km and 5\\u2009km (RL1), 5\\u2009km and \\n10\\u2009km (RL2), 10\\u2009km and 15\\u2009km (RL3) and 15\\u2009km and 20\\u2009km (RL4), respec-\\ntively. The specific RLj radius of each city is calculated by equation (3).\\nD= Dmin +(Dmax −Dmin)× (S−Smin)\\n(Smax −Smin), (3)\\nwhere D is the radius of the RLj; Dmin is the minimum radius of the RLj; \\nDmax is the maximum radius of the RLj; S is the urban area of the sample \\ncities; Smin is the minimum metropolitan area among all sample cities; \\nand Smax is the maximum urban area among all sample cities.\\nAnalytic method to determine rural land cover regions\\nAfter dividing urban and rural areas, the rural region (RLj) to maximize \\nthe surface UHI mitigation for each urban area can be determined by \\nR2. R2 is a parameter reflecting the goodness of a regression model51. \\nThis statistic also indicates the percentage of variance in the depend-\\nent variable that is jointly explained by the independent variables. In \\nother words, R2 offers a measure of how effectively the variations in \\nsurface UHII can be explained by the NRLC in the regression model52. \\nThe greater the extent to which rural land cover elucidates variations \\nin the UHI, the more pronounced its influence on UHI dynamics and its \\nefficacy in mitigating UHI effects. On the basis of this, seven machine \\nlearning models (Lasso regression, Ridge regression, ElasticNet regres-\\nsion, Random Forest regression, Support Vector regression, K-Nearest \\nNeighbors regression and Multilayer Perceptron regression) are used \\nto train the dataset (independent variable: LLPs and LCPs, dependent \\nvariable: surface UHII) in this study. These models are selected because \\nthey are significantly different in training methods and recognized for \\ntheir ability to train high-dimensional data with various capabilities53. \\nT o achieve better training results, a tenfold cross validation is used to \\ntune the model parameters. T o prevent model overfitting, the data-\\nset is divided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets. Random seeds \\nmay significantly affect the model training outcomes54. T o ensure the \\nrobustness of the results, random seeds controlling the division of the \\ntraining and test sets are not defined, and the model output parameters \\nare averaged over multiple training sessions55. The average values of \\nmodel output parameters reach equilibrium when the number of train-\\nings reaches 100. The R2 of each regression model in this study is the \\naverage value obtained after training 100 times. The non-parametric \\ntest is also used to test for significant differences in the training results \\nof different regression models, showing significant variability between \\nthe models. In this context, a single example will yield seven distinct \\nR2 values derived from seven separate regression models. The highest',\n",

Supplementary Fig. A1 shows the distribution of R2 \\nfor these regression models, and the appropriate model is determined \\nby comparing the R2 values.\\nRanking method of key landscape parameters for rural land \\ncover\\nOn the basis of the obtained corresponding combinations (RLj–ULi), \\nthe average marginal contribution of different landscape parameters to \\nUHI changes is calculated by coupling the SHAP model with the best-fit \\nmachine learning model obtained in the previous section. SHAP belongs \\nto the method of ex post interpretation. The basic idea is to calculate \\nthe marginal contribution of a feature when it is added to the model \\nand then take the mean value, that is, the SHAP baseline value of the \\nfeature, considering the different marginal contributions in the case of \\nall feature sequences. The SHAP values of LLPs and LCPs are sorted and \\naccumulated, and when the accumulated amount reaches 80% of the total \\nnumber, the parameters whose SHAP values are accumulated are chosen. \\nBecause these parameters may not be independent, considering all these \\nparameters may affect or even restrict each other when applying. There-\\nfore, the parameter screening is done by the correlation analysis. Most \\nof the existing data analysis studies use 0.5 to 0.7 as the correlation value \\nfor high-dimensional parameter screening56,57, and we chose the middle \\nvalue of 0.6 as the screening value for this study. In the set of data with \\ncorrelation coefficients greater than 0.6, parameters with smaller SHAP \\nvalues are eliminated. This is because the larger the SHAP value, the larger \\nthe effect of the parameter on the UHI within its own range of variation.\\nInfluence of the key rural landscape parameters responding \\nto UHI\\nALE are used to recognize the influencing patterns of key landscape \\nparameters on UHI mitigation. ALE is a global explanation technique \\nthat can describe how key parameters affect the prediction values from \\na machine learning model, which is a faster and unbiased alternative \\nto partial dependence plots. In this study, ALE can examine the rela -\\ntionship between feature values (that is, landscape parameters) and \\ntarget variables (that is, UHII). ALE averages and adds the difference \\nin predictions throughout the key landscape parameters, thereby \\nisolating the impacts of each feature value, which is at the cost of a \\ngreater number of observations and a nearly uniform distribution. \\nOverall, the ALE model shows the main effects of individual predictor \\nvariables and their second-order interactions in black-box supervised \\nlearning models that are easy to understand. According to the interac-\\ntive relationships between variables, ALE plots can be generated based \\non the fitted supervised learning model.\\nData analysis\\nThe data analysis process is shown in Supplementary Fig. A17, which \\ncan be considered as a nesting of three loops. The first level of the loop \\nis to train the LLPs and LCPs (independent variable) for a specific RL j \\nand the UHII (dependent variable) for a particular UL i through seven \\nmachine learning models. The regression model with the largest R 2 \\nis considered as the best trained. This regression model and the cor -\\nresponding R2, that is, explanation degree, are the output terms of \\nthe first layer of the loop. The first loop is to obtain the best-trained \\nmodel for the specified UL i and RL j (corresponding combination). \\nThe second level of the loop, based on the result of the first loop, can \\nbe used to compare the extent to which the land cover of different RLj \\naffects the UHI of a specified ULi. At the end, to output the rural region \\nthat has the most significant effect on the UHI of a specified UL i. The \\nfirst two layers of the cycle allow the first objective of this study to be \\nachieved. The criterion for judging whether to continue analyzing the \\nkey parameters and patterns of the impact of rural land affects the UHI \\n(the third level of the cycle) is whether there is a RLj of land cover that \\nhas a greater than 0° impact on the intensity of the heat island in that \\nurban ladder. The third level of the cycle performs the previous steps \\nonce in each of the five ULi to obtain the region of rural land cover that \\nhas the most significant impact on the UHI of the respective UL i and \\nthe impact extent of rural land cover on the UHI, that is, explanation \\ndegree. If explanation degree is less than 0, it suggests that the UHI \\nof this ULi is not affected by rural land cover. If explanation degree is \\ngreater than 0, the LLPs and LCPs of rural land cover are ranked from \\nthe largest to the smallest by SHAP value. Accumulation starts with the \\nfirst SHAP value and stops, when the value reaches 80% of the total. The \\naccumulated LLPs and LCPs are subjected to the correlation analysis, \\nand parameters with lower SHAP rankings in the set of parameters \\nwith correlation coefficients greater than 0.6 are deleted, which aims \\nto identify the key parameters of rural land cover affecting the UHI. \\nFinally, ALE plots of these key parameters are plotted to explain the \\npattern of UHI response to the key parameters.

UHI mitigation strategies have been investigated and utilized extensively within cities by the provision of green, blue or grey \\ninfrastructures. However, urban land is precious and limited for these interventions, making it challenging to address this issue. \\nNeighboring Rural Land Covers (NRLC) may serve as cooling sources, and have a great potential to mitigate UHI through processes \\nlike heat absorption and circulation. This study aims to address the following questions: 1) what is the location of NRLC to effectively \\nmitigate UHI for the entire city; and 2) what are the key parameters of landscape. We investigated the quantitative and qualitative \\nrelationships between rural land covers and UHI, drawing on geographical and environmental data from 30 Chinese cities between \\n2000 and 2020. We found that the rural land cover extending outward from the urban boundary, approximately half of the \\nequivalent diameter of city, had the most pronounced impact on UHI mitigation. The number and adjacency of landscape patches (a \\npatch is the basic constituent unit of a landscape pattern, which is a homogeneous non-linear area that differs from the \\nsurroundings) emerged as two key factors in mitigating UHI, with their individual potential to reduce UHI by up to 0.5°C. The \\nproposed recommendations were to avoid fragmentation and enhance landscape diversity and evenness. This work opens new \\navenues for addressing high-temperature urban catastrophes from rural perspective, which may also promote coordinated \\ndevelopment between urban and rural areas.\\nResearch sample Geographical and environmental data of 30 Chinese cities in 2000 to 2020, including land surface temperature and land cover data.\\nSampling strategy Chinese cities with urban areas larger than 200 square kilometers are chosen. China is ideal for urbanization-induced climate change \\ninvestigation owing to its rapid urbanization journey in the past 30 years. And extreme heat phenomenon pronounced mostly in large \\nurban cities.\\nData collection Land cover data for 2000 to 2020 were obtained through Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land \\nImager). Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity was calculated using remotely sensed land surface temperature data. Land surface \\ntemperature is considered to be strongly connected to near-ground temperature and is commonly employed to investigate the \\ngeographic and temporal features of the UHI impact. The land surface temperature dataset of the sample cities incorporates the \\nsynthetic temperature data of MOD11A1 V6.1/LSY_Day_1km in July and August. The monthly average of the daily land surface \\ntemperature was used to calculate the average summer land surface temperature for the sample cities.\\nTiming and spatial scale Land cover and surface temperature data in 2000 to 2020 were obtained.\\nData exclusions No data were excluded.\\nReproducibility Average values of 100 calculations of regression models were used to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of the results.\\nRandomization N/A\\nBlinding N/A\\nDid the study involve field work?

The study found that bare areas had \\nthe highest mean LST values compared to the urban and green areas. The results show that the difference in temperatures \\nbetween the bare areas and the urban areas ranges between 1 and 2\\xa0°C, between the bare areas and green areas ranges between \\n1 and 7\\xa0°C, and between the urban areas and green areas ranges between 1 and 5\\xa0°C. Furthermore, the LST values varied \\nfor each of the LULC categories, and hence some areas in the three categories had lower or higher LST values than in other \\ncategories. Hence, one category may not always have the highest LST value compared to other categories. The outcomes of \\nthis study may, therefore, have critical implications for urban planners who seek to mitigate UHI effects in arid and semi-\\narid urban areas.\\nKeywords Urban heat island\\xa0· Land surface temperature\\xa0· Land cover\\xa0· Arid and semi-arid region\\xa0· Mitigation policies\\nIntroduction\\nRapid urban sprawl typically results in the conversion of \\nopen spaces, such as natural land cover consisting of soil \\nand vegetation, into artificial surfaces, which consist of con-\\ncrete, asphalt, and other impervious surfaces. This process \\ninevitably results in changes in the absorption and reflec -\\ntion of solar radiation and the balance of surface energy. It \\nalso results in contrast changes to the urban-surroundings/\\nurban–rural environment, in terms of surface radiance and \\nair temperature. This difference in ambient air temperature \\nbetween the urban-surroundings/urban–rural areas results in \\na phenomenon known as Urban Heat Islands (UHI) (Aflaki \\net\\xa0al. 2017; Mohajerani et\\xa0al. 2017; Zhao et\\xa0al. 2016; Santa-\\nmouris 2015). This variation in temperature is what consti-\\ntutes the UHI effect. Various studies have found that UHIs \\ncan increase the air temperature in urban areas between 2 \\nand 15\\xa0°C (Aflaki et\\xa0al. 2017). In arid and semi-arid regions, \\nthe temperature in urban area centers can increase in the \\nrange of 2–4\\xa0°C when compared to their surroundings \\n(Wong et\\xa0al. 2016; Martin et\\xa0al. 2014). The spatial patterns \\nof UHIs in urban areas reflect the different natures of the \\nvarious components and factors that affect them. One main \\nreason that causes this phenomenon is human activity, which \\ncreates dense, built-up areas that produce excess heat energy. \\nThis energy is captured by UHIs during the day and is dif-\\nfused at night (Oke 1982).\\nThe thermal balance and the intensity of an UHI is a func-\\ntion of different elements, including weather and climate \\nconditions (i.e., rainfall availability, moisture), urbanization, \\npopulation dynamics, the size and the density of an urban \\narea (horizontal and vertical urban expansion), morphology \\n(topography and sky view factors), urban design (spacing \\nbetween buildings and location of public places), water \\nbodies and sea reclamation, land use/land cover (LULC) \\ncharacteristics, the ratio of green areas, anthropogenic heat \\nproduction, and the types of materials used in construction \\n(Qaida et\\xa0al. 2016; Grover and Singh 2015; O’Malleya et\\xa0al. \\n2015). These factors will affect the intensity and spatial pat-\\nterns of UHIs. On the other hand, UHIs will affect surface \\ntemperatures, evaporation rates, energy consumption rates, \\ndegrees of solar radiation absorption, impair water quality \\ntransmission from the heat to the soil, elevate greenhouse \\ngases and emissions of air pollutants, the albedo of the area, \\nheat storage capacity, and ultimately will jeopardize human \\n * Ammar Abulibdeh \\n aabulibdeh@qu.edu.qa\\n1 Department of\\xa0Humanities, College of\\xa0Arts and\\xa0Sciences, \\nQatar University, Doha, Qatar',\n",

Additionally, UHIs can affect wind tur-\\nbulence, which can directly alter the near-surface atmos-\\npheric environments over urban areas (Estoque et\\xa0al. 2017; \\nZhou et\\xa0al. 2016).\\nThe characteristics of manmade materials are another \\nfactor that influence UHIs. These materials, which are used \\nin transforming the natural surface to urban built-up ele-\\nments, can store shortwave radiation, release latent and sen-\\nsible heat through evaporation and convection processes, \\nemit infrared radiation, block prevailing winds, and store \\nheat (Boehme et\\xa0al. 2015; O’Malleya et\\xa0al. 2015; Dimoudi \\net\\xa0al. 2014). The optical and thermal features of the mate-\\nrial (i.e., density, thermal capacitance, short-wave radiation \\nreflectivity, conductivity, and emissivity) have significant \\nimpacts on the distribution of the ambient temperature in \\nurban areas (Coseo and Larsen 2014). On the other hand, the \\nsurrounding areas are usually composed of natural surfaces \\n(i.e., plants and soils) that release water vapor into the air \\nand keep the area cool.\\nA significant number of studies have thoroughly inves-\\ntigated and analyzed the UHI phenomenon, which has cre-\\nated feedback for researchers and policymakers (Meng et\\xa0al. \\n2018; Gu and Li 2018; Jun et\\xa0al. 2017; Yang and Lin 2016; \\nBokaiea et\\xa0al. 2016; Wang et\\xa0al. 2016). The relationship \\nbetween urban features and UHIs can be summarized in \\nfour key points, as suggested by the literature (Gago et\\xa0al. \\n2013; Jun et\\xa0al. 2017): (1) green areas, pavement, and build-\\nings are the most significant elements on temperature vari-\\nations at the local level; (2) the distribution of buildings and \\nurban structures in urban areas influences the development \\nof the UHI phenomenon; (3) the presence of tall buildings \\nand narrow streets increases the effects of UHIs as they \\ncapture warm air and decrease airflow; and (4) water and \\ngreen spaces are significant components that can mitigate \\nthe effects of UHIs.\\nIn the literature, LST has been identified as one of the \\nmost significant factors that can influence the UHI phenom-\\nenon (Song et\\xa0al. 2014; Zhou et\\xa0al. 2011). LST informa-\\ntion has been widely used in UHI research and is usually \\nobtained from remote sensing data, which is a unique source \\nof information for determining UHIs (Tran et\\xa0al. 2017; Di \\nLeo et\\xa0al. 2016; Feyisa et\\xa0al. 2014). These studies used \\nremote sensing images to retrieve land-use information, \\nwhich then classified LULC into the following categories: \\nbuilt-up areas, green areas (i.e., parks, forests, vegetation), \\nwater, or recreational land (Heusinkveld et\\xa0al. 2014; Choi \\net\\xa0al. 2014; Emmanuel and Loconsole 2015; Fan et\\xa0al. 2015; \\nFadda et\\xa0al. 2019). Many studies emphasized the relation-\\nship between LST and LULC and its consequences on UHIs. \\nThese studies concluded that LST is directly correlated with \\nbuilt-up areas and has an inverse relationship with green \\nareas. The examination of LST data based on LULC changes \\nis significant enough to initiate policies that can mitigate the \\neffects of UHIs, as well as adopt new land-use planning and \\nurban design strategies and policies for arid and semi-arid \\nurban areas. Several studies used remote sensing images for \\nthe investigation, derivation, and monitoring of LST and \\nUHI effect (Duan et\\xa0al. 2017; Berger et\\xa0al. 2017; Estoque \\net\\xa0al. 2017; Jalan and Sharma 2017; Makido et\\xa0al. 2016). \\nThese images are inimitable dataset, which make it possi-\\nble of attaining frequent wall-to-wall coverage of a coveted \\ncontext. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing provides a \\nstraightforward and consistent method of measuring LST \\nover extended regions and hence it is considered the most \\neffective method in studying the UHI effect and in measur -\\ning the LST at regional and global scales (Duan et\\xa0al. 2017). \\nThe thermal bands of these images facilitate the process of \\nobtaining and deriving the UHI intensity (Berger et\\xa0al. 2017; \\nJalan and Sharma 2017; Pan 2016). These images can be \\nused to derive the LULC and LST and subsequently UHI \\nintensity. The utilization of thermal bands of Landsat TM/\\nETM/OLI in several studies can be attributed to many factors \\nsuch as availability, world-wide coverage with a good spatial \\nresolution, long-term temporal coverage, and the presence \\nof thermal and thematic spectral bands that are important to \\nstudy the UHI phenomenon (Deilami et\\xa0al. 2018). Satellite \\nthermal infrared (TIRS) measurements are widely used to \\nretrieve LST with relatively high accuracy and high spatial \\nresolution. On the other hand, some limitations associated \\nwith utilizing these images include a long time of the satel-\\nlites revisit to the same area (16\\xa0days), the large image size, \\nand their inability to penetrate clouds. In addition, the spatial \\nresolution of thermal and thematic bands may not be suitable \\nfor detailed LST/UHI investigation. Furthermore, different \\nelements may affect the precise measurement of emissiv -\\nity (such as noise of sensor, atmospheric effect, aerosols) \\nand hence the measurement of LST (Krehbiel and Henebry \\n2016; Jiménez-Muñoz and Sobrino 2006). These limitations \\nmake these images not suitable for monitoring changes in \\nLST within the day or a short period as well as the need to \\nprocess multiple images to mosaic them when focusing on \\nnational or regional scales, which increase the processing \\ntime significantly (Deilami et\\xa0al. 2018). Nevertheless, in arid \\nand semi-arid areas (such as our study area), the sky is clear \\nfrom the clouds most of the time during the year particularly \\nin the summer season, which overcome the limitation of \\nusing satellite images in studying the UHI effect.\\nDifferent methodologies and techniques were used to \\ninvestigate the UHIs phenomena and to classify the LULC. \\nSome studies used model simulation (Litardo et\\xa0al. 2020; \\nGiridharan and Emmanuel 2018; Li et\\xa0al. 2018; Kleerekoper \\net\\xa0al. 2017). For example, this method was used for studying \\nthe effect of urban compactness and different urban layouts \\nunder temperate climate conditions on UHI. Other studies \\nused the model simulation method to investigate the influ-\\nence of different greenery and thermo-physic parameters',\n",
       " 'Environmental Earth Sciences (2021) 80:259 \\n1 3 Page 3 of 26 259\\nand different types of pavements (i.e. leaf evapotranspira-\\ntion rate, albedo), or specific urban layouts on the formation \\nand intensity of UHI phenomenon. These models are used \\nto address what if scenarios, but not the real parameters of \\nthe problem.\\nOther studies used statistical analysis of temperature \\nrecords from observational stations in investigating UHI \\nphenomenon. Some studies used the ordinary least squares \\n(OLS) regression is associated with Pearson’s correlation \\n(Henits et\\xa0al. 2017; Estoque et\\xa0al. 2017; Chen et\\xa0al. 2017; \\nHaashemi et\\xa0al. 2016; Fan et\\xa0al. 2015; Zhao et\\xa0al. 2014). This \\nmodel is used to examine the UHI effect for a large area. \\nHowever, other studies (Deilami and Kamruzzaman 2017; \\nDeilami et\\xa0al. 2016) find that UHI effect varies significantly \\nover space (i.e. context sensitive) and hence this phenom-\\nenon should be modelled locally. Therefore, some studies \\nused geographical weighted regression (GWR) models to \\ninvestigate the UHI (Deilami et\\xa0al. 2016). The GWR was \\nfound to have better explanatory power than OLS model. \\nSome studies used comparative analysis for investigating \\nand modeling this phenomenon (Guo et\\xa0al. 2020; Jalan and \\nSharma 2017; Pal and Ziaul 2017; Singh et\\xa0al. 2017; Cui \\net\\xa0al. 2016). This method is based on investigating the UHI \\neffects and the classification of LULC. To provide compre-\\nhensive results, this method was used in some studies with \\nother statistical methods such as the OLS.\\nSeveral studies have investigated the relationship between \\nLST and the distribution and spatial patterns of impervi-\\nous urban surfaces and green areas, but few have considered \\ncities in arid and semi-arid regions. Many of these studies \\nfocused on individual cities, however, a study that considers \\nthe Gulf region is lacking, and comparative monitoring of \\nUHIs in various cities is rather limited. Therefore, this study \\ninvestigates the relationship between LST and the abundance \\nand spatial pattern of impervious urban surfaces, green \\nareas, and bare areas in multiple cities in the Gulf region. \\nThis study differs from others in several ways. First, no other \\nstudies have empirically analyzed the impacts of LC changes \\non the development of UHIs in eight main cities in the Gulf \\nregion. Second, this study assesses the spatiotemporal vari-\\nations of the UHIs over eight major cities. Finally, this study \\ncontributes to the literature by examining the interactions \\nbetween land cover and LST over time in arid and semi-arid \\nregions.\\nThis study aims to investigate the impacts of LC on LST, \\nand hence the development of UHIs as well as the mitiga-\\ntion processes in eight different urban metropolitan cities in \\narid and semi-arid regions using multi-spectral and multi-\\ntemporal satellite data. The study investigates how urbani-\\nzation and population growth affect the thermal behavior of \\nUHIs. The LSTs and the normalized difference in vegetation \\nindices (NDVI) were retrieved from remote sensing images. \\nIn this study, spatial and temporal LST data were extracted \\nin three phases (e.g., in 1990, 2000, and 2018) and were \\nanalyzed for spatial distribution changes in temperature and \\nLULC, using Landsat images. A quantitative approach was \\nused to investigate the relationships between LULC, NDVI, \\nand LST. High spatial and temporal resolution Landsat-5 \\nThematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data were \\nused to analyze, map, and assess spatial and temporal vari-\\nations in UHIs and determine their relationship with urban \\nsurface characteristics. For each city, LST for green areas, \\nurban areas, and bare areas were analyzed. This study mainly \\nfocused on the summer period with the following objective: \\nto assess the spatial distribution of LST and its correlation \\nwith LULC, as well as the role of LULC in the develop-\\nment of atmospheric UHI and the resulting variations in the \\nmicroclimate within the canopy layer.\\nStudy area\\nThe cities observed in this study were: Doha in Qatar, Abu \\nDhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), \\nRiyadh and Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mus-\\ncat in the Sultanate of Oman, Kuwait City in Kuwait, and \\nManamah in the Kingdom of Bahrain (see Fig.\\xa01). The eight \\ncities are primacy cities in the Gulf Region and the core of \\ntheir countries in population and economic growth. In addi-\\ntion, these cities have been among the most rapidly growing \\ncities in the world over the last few decades, and serve as \\nhubs for regional development.\\nClimate characteristics\\nAccording to Koppen-Geiger climate classification, the Gulf \\nregion, including the eight cities, is classified as Tropical \\nand Subtropical Desert Climate (BWh). The Region is char-\\nacterized by having two seasons, summer and winter. The \\nsummer season extends between April and October and it is \\nscorching, where the average temperature ranges between \\n32 and 38\\xa0°C (see Table\\xa0 1), and the temperature can rise \\nto 50\\xa0°C in the continental cities such as Riyadh with low \\nrelative humidity during June or July. The precipitation is \\nminimal during the summer season. Simultaneously, the \\ntemperature in some coastal cities can rise to more than \\n40\\xa0°C such as in Kuwait City with relative humidity up to \\n90%. On the other hand, the winter season extends between \\nNovember and March and is characterized by moderate tem-\\nperature as the average temperature in the coldest months \\nranges between 13 and 23\\xa0°C and could rise to 26\\xa0°C in some \\ncoastal areas. The relative humidity is low during the winter \\nseason. The precipitation is sparse and ranges between 43 \\nand 160\\xa0mm. The precipitation in the winter is mainly due \\nto the cold northern winds from the Mediterranean region \\nmeeting the weather depression from the Indian Ocean.',\n",

LST was derived from Landsat 8 and Landsat 5 data. \\nIn Landsat 8, band 10 was used, while band 6 was used \\nfor Landsat 5. In this study, the images of eight cities were \\nused, which are freely accessible from NASA and were cor-\\nrected for radiometric and geometrical errors (level-1 prod-\\nucts http:// earth explo rer. usgs. gov/). The characteristics of \\nthe eight images used for the analysis are summarised in \\nTable\\xa03.\\nSpatial resolution of an imagery is important when \\nstudying the effects of the spatial pattern of land use/land \\ncover (LULC) on LST. High temporal resolution is usu -\\nally used in conjunction with extensive time coverage to \\ninvestigate the air temperature UHI and to describe its \\ntemporal variation (Li et\\xa0al. 2013). However, one of the \\nshortcomings of the temporal resolution is that it fails to \\nreflect the spatial variation of UHI. Therefore, surface tem-\\nperature UHI is used to provide a simultaneous surface \\ntemperature of a large area (Li et\\xa0al. 2013; Weng 2009). \\nDifferent studies on UHI used remotely sensed image \\ndata with a different spatial resolution to generate differ -\\nent LULC maps (Vannier et\\xa0al. 2011; Liu and Weng 2009; \\nTownsend et\\xa0al. 2009; Weng et\\xa0al. 2004).

Weng \\net\\xa0al. (2004) found that the 120\\xa0m is the optimal resolution \\nin explaining the relationship between LST and NDVI. Li \\net\\xa0al.

They used three spatial resolu -\\ntions (2.44\\xa0m, 10\\xa0m, and 30\\xa0m) to measure the spatial \\npattern of greenspace based on seven landscape metrics. \\nThey found that the greenspace spatial pattern is more \\naccurately quantified using images with high spatial reso-\\nlution, and hence the relationship between LST and the \\nspatial configuration of greenspaces differ based on the \\nspatial resolution.

This indicates the inversion of the UHI phenomenon in \\nthese cities, as sand constitutes the main bare surfaces, and \\nthus absorbs more sunlight than urban or green areas due to \\nsand’s low reflectivity.

On the other hand, the difference in mean \\nLST values between the bare areas and urban areas ranged \\nbetween 2\\xa0°C in Dubai and Jeddah and 1\\xa0°C in the rest of \\nthe cities, in 1990. This difference was also observed for \\nthe year 2000, but the range in the mean LST between the \\nvarious land covers types changed.

The variations in mean LST values were \\nless significant, as it ranged between 0 and 2\\xa0°C, as shown \\nin Fig.\\xa0 6b. On the other hand, mean LST value variations \\nbetween the urban areas and green areas were between 1 and \\n4\\xa0°C. In 2018, the variations followed the same patterns as \\nthe previous years, as the mean LST values varied between \\n1\\xa0°C in Riyadh and 7\\xa0°C in Abu Dhabi, as shown in Fig.\\xa06c. \\nThe mean LST value ranges for the bare areas and urban \\nareas were between 0 and 3\\xa0°C, while for the urban areas and \\nthe green areas the values were between 1 and 4\\xa0°C.\\nImpact of\\xa0urban areas on\\xa0LST in\\xa0arid and\\xa0semi‑arid \\nregions\\nThe UHI spatial distributions and patterns for the urban \\nareas are a reflection of their different components. The \\nproximity of dense urban areas intensifies the UHI phe -\\nnomena, due to human activity, the materials used for urban \\nconstruction, the excessive use of artificial cooling systems, \\nand traffic-induced air pollution (Bokaiea et\\xa0al. 2016).\\nThe relationship between LST and the urban areas is pre-\\nsented in a box and whiskers plot, as shown in Fig.\\xa0 7. This \\nrelationship is based on the combination of the urban area \\nmap with the LST map, which was accomplished using GIS \\nsoftware. Figure\\xa0 7 shows that the LST of the urban areas \\nis not homogenous but somewhat varies within each city, \\nas there is an extensive range between the minimum and \\nmaximum temperature. This variation depends on the char-\\nacteristics of the urban location. For example, as shown in \\nFig.\\xa05, there are some urban areas with a higher LST than \\nthe mean LST of the bare areas.

These differences indicate that there is not one LC \\ncategory that has a higher or lower LST than the others. \\nExcept for Riyadh, all the other cities are coastal, and hence \\nthe presence of sea breeze is a significant element that may \\nsignificantly influence the amplitude and characteristics of \\nthe UHI effects near coastal areas.\\nIn this study, more than 8000 points were selected using \\nthe fishnet grid tool in ArcMap 10.7 software to study the \\nrelationship between NDBI and LST in the form of two-\\ndimensional scatter plots in the eight cities (Fig.\\xa0 8). The \\nfigure shows that LST is positively correlated with the NDBI \\nvalues so that LST increases by increasing the NDBI values. \\nThe NDBI values are concentrated between 0.01 and 0.2 \\nin many of these cities with corresponding LST between \\n30 and 50\\xa0°C. These NDBI values represent the clustered \\nurban areas. The negative NDBI values correspond with \\nlower LST, as these values are urban areas associated with \\nmore green areas. Table\\xa0 7 shows the statistical correlation \\nbetween the LST and NDBI. The entries show that there is \\na significant positive correlation between LST and NDBI \\nvalues in all eight cities.\\nInvestigating the LST in urban areas also shows that the \\ncoastal areas have the lowest LST in the urban areas, as the \\nsea breeze transfers cooler air to the adjacent areas of the \\ncost and enhances wind speeds. Although LST increases as \\nthe distance from the coast increases, other factors play a \\nsignificant role in increasing or decreasing LST, including \\nthe geometry of the buildings, population density, and the \\npresence of green areas. In Riyadh, the highest LST was \\nfound in areas near the bare lands, while it decreased near \\nthe green areas. There were some locations in these cities \\nthat had intense UHIs during the study period. Investigat-\\ning these places revealed that they were mainly induced by \\nindustrial and commercial land.\\nUrbanization also significantly increases urban tem-\\nperatures. High residential, commercial, and industrial \\ndensities result in the trapping of energy in walls. This is \\nbecause these materials have a high heat capacity, which \\nleads to the excessive use of artificial cooling systems \\nby residents, and results in anthropogenic heat in urban \\nareas. The use of unnatural materials (such as asphalt, \\nconcrete, cement, etc.), changes the nature of these areas \\nand increases the prevalence of dark surfaces with low \\nalbedos (greater absorption of solar energy), reduction in \\ngreen areas, and increased anthropogenic heat production. \\nAdditionally, population growth influences the maximum \\ntemperatures during warm periods, resulting in elevated \\nair temperatures in these areas and, consequently, the \\noccurrence of UHIs (Stone et\\xa0al. 2010; Liu et\\xa0al. 2007). \\nTherefore, understanding the urban fabric and the exist-\\nence of LULCs in these urban areas is fundamental to \\ncreating better UHI mitigation strategies. Giannopoulou \\net\\xa0al. (2011) investigated how urban activities contribute to \\nthe occurrence of UHIs and concluded that the formation \\nof this phenomenon was reinforced by increased urbani -\\nzation and industrialization, coupled with a decrease in \\ngreen areas which resulted in increased anthropogenic heat \\nflows.\\nThe impact of\\xa0bare areas on\\xa0LST in\\xa0arid \\nand\\xa0semi‑arid regions\\nThe bare areas within and surrounding the city’s urban \\nareas mainly consist of sand. Figure\\xa0 7 shows that the bare \\nareas have the highest LST values, and the mean LST \\nvalue was the highest compared to the urban and green \\nareas, as shown in Table\\xa0 6.

       " 'Environmental Earth Sciences (2021) 80:259 \\n1 3 Page 17 of 26 259\\nOne reason that the LST was high in the bare areas in \\nthese cities was due to heat concentration, sparse vegeta-\\ntion cover, deficient relative humidity, and topsoil aridity in \\nthe upper layers of the sandy soil. Additionally, variations \\nin LST in the bare areas may be due to the soil properties \\n(color, crust, type of minerals). LST was therefore affected \\nby the water content of the topsoil in the bare areas. Sandy \\nsoils have lower water content, which results in higher LST \\nvalues. Sandy soil is characterized by lower water holding \\ncapabilities and smaller thermal inertia. Therefore, during \\nthe summer, the sandy soil has lower water content and a \\nfaster depletion rate, which leads to a higher LST. Therefore, \\nthere is a positive correlation between sand and LST in these \\nareas. On the contrary, other types of soils, such as clay soil \\nthat is used for planting, have higher water-holding capabili-\\nties. Thus, the higher the water content in the soil, the slower \\nthe depletion rate, which results in a lower LST.\\nImpacts of\\xa0green areas on\\xa0LST in\\xa0arid and\\xa0semi‑arid \\nregions\\nThe LST values of the green areas were derived from the \\nmap intersections of the NDVI values and the LST. More \\nthan 8000 points were selected using fishnet grid tool in Arc-\\nMap 10.7 software to study the relationship between NDVI \\nand LST in the form of two-dimensional scatter plots in the \\neight cities. Figure\\xa09 shows that there is an adverse correla-\\ntion between LST and NDVI values. The LST decreases \\nby increasing the amount of green areas. This emphasizes \\nthe role of green areas in mitigating the UHI by reducing \\nthe LST. Furthermore, the entries in Table\\xa0 8 indicate that \\nthere was a siginificant negative relationship between LST \\nand NDVI values. There was some useful information that \\ncould be extracted from this negative relationship between \\nLST and NDVI values. First, the role of green areas is more \\nevident in reducing the LST in the eight cities, as the areas \\nwith the highest levels of vegetation cover have the lowest \\nLST values. This emphasizes the incontrovertible conclusion \\nthat green areas mitigate UHIs. Second, the range between \\nthe minimum and the maximum LST was high for all the \\ncities and worth further investigation. The green areas with \\nhigh temperatures represent the lower NDVI values and \\nthus are related to sparse vegetation found in the bare areas. \\nAlthough the role of green areas to reduce UHI effects is \\nundeniable, different factors may affect the negative correla-\\ntion between LST and NDVI, including the role of evapo-\\ntranspiration and soil moisture. Other reasons could be the \\nabundance, green space configuration, and the proximity of \\nwater bodies. Additionally, the dry weather, particularly in \\nRiyadh City, plays a vital role in reducing the NDVI val -\\nues because the vegetation is under water stress.

The lowest \\nLST for the green areas were found in areas characterized by \\ndense vegetation and near water bodies. On the other hand, \\nthe highest LST for the green areas were related to patches \\nof vegetation located in the bare areas. In the urban areas, the \\namount of vegetation has a significant effect on the distribu-\\ntion of the UHIs, where the size and density of the vegeta-\\ntion create cool island effects. Therefore, we can conclude \\nfrom Fig.\\xa07 that the influence of green areas does not always \\nsignificantly reduce LST, specifically if the green areas are \\nscattered near built-up environments and bare areas.\\nPlanning for\\xa0mitigating UHI in\\xa0arid \\nand\\xa0semi‑arid cities\\nA variety of strategies, policies, and techniques had been \\nproposed, recommended, and implemented in various cit-\\nies to counterbalance the impacts of UHI effects, as well as \\nmoderate temperatures and elevate the adaptive capacities of \\nurban areas to a warming climate. These strategies have con-\\nsisted of using cooling materials, increasing the ratio of veg-\\netation and water in the urban environment, as well as reduce \\nanthropogenic heat, and water. However, the implementation \\nand effectiveness of these strategies depend on many vari-\\nables, and only some of these can be considered in urban \\nplanning policies or urban contexts (density, scale, design, \\ngeometry). Other elements include environmental conditions \\nsuch as scale, geography, climatology, and surface topol-\\nogy. Therefore, this section aims to review and determine \\nthe mitigation strategies and techniques of the UHI effects \\nin arid and semi-arid cities. The aim is to provide evidence \\nand practical guidance for environmental professionals so \\nthat developmental policies and projects can be optimized \\nto minimize the effects of UHIs and moderate urban micro-\\nclimates in arid and semi-arid cities. Such strategies may be \\nconsidered in the planning process to reduce city tempera-\\ntures, particularly in the summer.\\nThe result of this study illustrates the importance of green \\nareas in reducing the UHI effects. Furthermore, many stud-\\nies have concluded that urban greening is a robust strategy \\nin reducing LST and hence mitigating the effects of UHIs. \\nHowever, this strategy is costly in arid and semi-arid regions \\ndue to water scarcity and the resulting cost associated with \\nit (Abulibdeh and Zaidan 2020; Abulibdeh et\\xa0al. 2019b). \\nHence, it can be used with other strategies to reduce the \\nnegative consequences of UHIs.\\nIncreasing the ratio of green spaces in urban areas is con-\\nsidered a significant way to reduce the effects of UHIs, as \\ngreen spaces have substantial impacts on the thermal con-\\nditions of urban areas. Urban green areas, when combined \\nwith high sky view factors, are characterized by lower air \\nand surface temperatures than other LULCs, such as built-\\nup areas (Tan et\\xa0al. 2015; Doick et\\xa0al. 2014; Li et\\xa0al. 2012). \\nVegetation, particularly trees, can prevent direct surface heat \\nas a result of solar radiation by providing shade, cooling the \\nair through generating cool island effects, by evapotranspi-\\nration and emissivity processes, and by reducing the wind \\nspeed under the canopies (Santamouris 2015; Li et\\xa0al. 2012; \\nHamada and Ohta, 2010). Planting trees in the wind direc-\\ntion also elevates the cooling abilities of each tree (Tan et\\xa0al. \\n2015; Doick et\\xa0al. 2014). For example, Doick et\\xa0al. (2014) \\nconcluded that the cooling effects of urban greenery were \\nsignificant on warm nights with light wind speeds. There-\\nfore, many studies suggest that creating more green areas for \\nmore efficient and stable cooling effects as the boundaries \\nof the cooling effect may have variable effects (Myint et\\xa0al. \\n2013; Maimaitiyiming et\\xa0al. 2014; Morabito et\\xa0al. 2016 ). \\nRafiee et\\xa0al.

Fur-\\nthermore, green areas stabilize the temperature variations \\ncaused by the building materials. However, green areas can \\nreduce or increase the energy consumption of adjacent build-\\nings, depending on the size of green areas, the tree species, \\nthe climate of the site, and the ratio of trees to the surface \\narea.

Therefore, \\nthe combined effects of shading and evapotranspiration in \\nparks and green areas result in a significant decrease in LST. \\nThis phenomenon is known as cool islands in urban areas. \\nFurthermore, the presence of green areas in urban environ-\\nments can decrease the energy consumption required for \\ncooling in summer and reduce or stabilize the temperature \\nchanges produced by building materials.

The analy -\\nsis is based on LC classification (urban, green, and bare \\nareas). The results showed that the bare areas have the \\nhighest mean temperatures. However, the range between \\nthe minimum and the maximum LST in each of the land-\\ncover categories was not always from one category. \\nAlthough the mean LST in the bare areas was the highest, \\nthere were some areas in the urban and green areas with \\nhigher LST. This indicates that other factors may play a \\ncrucial role in determining LSTs and hence the UHIs. Abu \\nDhabi city has the highest variation in mean LST and this \\nmight be due to green cover and nearness to the water. \\nThe temperature difference between the bare areas and \\nthe urban areas ranges between 1 and 2\\xa0°C, between the \\nbare areas and green areas ranges between 2 and 7\\xa0°C, and \\nbetween the urban areas and green areas ranges between \\n1 and 6\\xa0°C.\\nResults showed that UHIs in the eight cities are func-\\ntion of urban surface properties, mainly built-up and green \\nareas. In the analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient, \\nthe LST has a significant relationship with both NDBI and \\nNDVI indices but with different directions. The relation-\\nship between the LST and NDBI was significantly positive \\nindicating that urban areas can elevate the UHI effect. On the \\nother hand, the relationship between the LST and NDVI is \\nnegative indicating that the presence of the green areas miti-\\ngate the UHI effect. However, the bare areas have the high-\\nest mean LST compared to the other land cover categories. \\nThis demonstrates that urban and green areas in arid and \\nsemi-arid regions generate an overall cooling effect albite \\nin different degrees. Although green areas are found to gen-\\nerated the largest cooling effect, the urban areas dominate \\nthese cities and hence are responsible for the preponderance \\nof heat sink in these cities. Furthermore, there was spatial \\nheterogeneity in LST across each category, depending on \\ndifferent variables such as the nearness to the sea or the \\ndensity of the urban and green areas. Thus monitoring the \\ntime-series of LST is a useful tool to investigate and monitor \\nthe UHI growth in these cities.\\nA variety of strategies, policies, and techniques had been \\nproposed, recommended, and implemented in various cities \\nto counterbalance the impacts of UHI effects, as well as to \\nmoderate temperatures and elevate the adaptive capacities \\nof urban areas to a warming climate. These strategies have \\nconsisted of using cooling materials, increasing the ratio of \\nvegetation and water in the urban environment, as well as \\nreduce anthropogenic heat and water. However, the imple-\\nmentation and effectiveness of these strategies depend on \\nmany variables, and only some of these can be considered in \\nurban planning policies in arid and semi-arid cities. In such \\ncities, it is possible to apply a variety of strategies and poli-\\ncies to mitigate the effects of UHIs. Based on the findings \\nof this study, green spaces significantly influence LST vari-\\nations in urban areas and hence are the essential elements to \\nbe considered in urban planning. Furthermore, the countries \\nin the Gulf region can develop green standard initiatives and \\nstandards that require UHI mitigation actions to be applied \\nin new buildings. These standards should represent a man-\\ndatory set of building performance standards, and utilizing \\nhigh-albedo materials should be one of the recommended \\noptions for building envelops and urban infrastructure.\\nFuture studies should consider nighttime data, multiple \\ndaytime readings, and seasonal variation to attain more \\ndepth analysis of the UHI formation in arid and semi-arid \\nareas.

       " 'Cool Roofs \\nC\\nool roofing can help address the \\nproblem of heat islands, which re\\xad\\nsults in part from the combined heat \\nof numerous individual hot roofs in a city \\nor suburb. Cool roofing products are made \\nof highly reflective and emissive materials \\nthat can remain approximately 50 to 60°F \\n(28-33°C) cooler than traditional materials \\nduring peak summer weather. Building own\\xad\\ners and roofing contractors have used these \\ntypes of cool roofing products for more than \\n20 years. Traditional roofs in the United \\nStates, in contrast, can reach summer peak \\ntemperatures of 150 to 185°F (66-85°C),\\n2 \\nthus creating a series of hot surfaces as well \\nas warmer air temperatures nearby. \\nThis chapter provides detailed information \\nthat mitigation progr\\nam organizers can use \\nto understand, plan, and implement cool \\nroofing projects and programs. The chapter \\ndiscusses: \\n•\\t Key cool roof properties and how they \\nhelp to mitigate urban heat \\n•\\t Types of cool roofing \\n•\\t Specific benefits and costs of cool roofing \\n•\\t Measurement and certification of cool \\nroof produc\\nts \\n•\\t Installation and maintenance of cool roofs \\n•\\t Tools and resources to further explore \\nthis technology\\n. \\nOpportunities to Expand Use of Cool \\nRoofs in Urban Areas \\nMost U.S. cities have significant opportunities to \\nincrease the use of cool roofs.

       " '3 .  Benefits and Costs \\nThe use of cool roofs as a mitigation strat\\xad\\negy brings many benefits, including lower \\nenergy use, reduced air pollution and \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and improved \\nhuman health and comfort. At the same \\ntime, there can be a cost premium for some \\ncool roof applications versus traditional \\nroofing materials. This section highlights \\nsome of the key benefits and costs of cool \\nroof programs and individual projects. \\nSection 6 also introduces cool roof energy \\nsavings calculators that community plan\\xad\\nners or individual building owners can use \\nto help determine whether to pursue cool \\nroofs as a mitigation option. \\n3.1 Benefits \\nReduced Energy Use. A cool roof trans\\xad\\nfers less heat to the building below, so the \\nbuilding stays cooler and more comfortable \\nand uses less energy for cooling. Every \\nbuilding responds differently to the effects \\nof a cool roof. For example, Table 1 lists \\nexamples of the general characteristics and \\ncooling energy savings of different one-\\nstory buildings in California, Florida, and \\nTexas. The measured savings varied from \\n10 to almost 70 percent of each build\\xad\\ning’s total cooling energy use. In addition, \\na 2004 report summarized more than 25 \\narticles about the cooling energy used by \\nbuildings with cool roofs and identified \\nenergy savings ranging from 2 to over 40 \\npercent, with average savings of about 20 \\npercent.\\n9 \\nLocal climate and site-specific factors, such \\nas insulation levels, duct placement, and \\nattic configuration, play an important role \\nin the amount of savings achieved (see \\nthe range in Table 1). Other site-specific \\nvariables also can strongly influence the \\namount of energy a particular building \\nwill save. For example, a study of a San \\nJose, California, drug store documented \\ncooling energy savings of only 2 percent. \\nThe cooling demands in this store w\\nere \\ndriven by the design of the building, in\\xad\\ncluding a radiant barrier under the roof \\nand a well ventilated plenum space, so that \\nheat transfer through the roof contributed \\nlittle to the store’s cooling demand.\\n10 Thus, \\nin gauging potential energy savings for a \\nparticular building, the building owners \\nwill need to consider a range of factors to \\nmake cool roofing work for them. \\nAnother benefit of cool roofing is that it \\nsa\\nves energy when most needed—during \\npeak electrical demand periods that gen\\xad\\nerally occur on hot, summer weekday \\nafternoons, when offices and homes are \\nrunning cooling systems, lights, and appli\\xad\\nances. By reducing cooling system needs, a \\ncool roof can help building owners reduce \\npeak electricity demand. The last column in \\nTable 1 lists reductions in the peak demand \\nfor cooling energy that range from 14 to 38 \\npercent after installation of a cool roof. \\nLower peak demand not only saves on total \\nelec\\ntrical use but also can reduce demand \\nfees that some utilities charge commercial \\nand industrial building owners. Unlike \\nresidential customers, who pay for only the \\namount of electricity they use, commercial \\nand industrial customers often pay an ad\\xad\\nditional fee based on the amount of peak \\npower they demand. Because cool roofing \\nhelps reduce their peak demand, it lowers \\nthese costs. \\nInsulation and R-Values \\nThe “R-value” of building insulation \\nindicates its ability to impede heat \\nflow. Higher R-values are correlated \\nwith greater insulating properties. \\nREDUCING URBAN HEAT ISLANDS – DRAFT 8',\n",

Electrici\\xad\\nty has traditionally been more expensive \\nthan natural gas per unit of energy, so \\nthe net annual energy savings translate \\ninto overall annual utility bill savings. \\nNote, however, that natural gas and elec\\xad\\ntricity prices have been volatile in some \\nparts of the country, particularly since \\n2000. As shown in Figure 10, with el\\xad\\nevated natural gas prices in recent years, \\nthe net benefit in terms of cost savings \\nmight be small in certain northern cities \\nwith high heating demands. \\nCalifornia-based research indicates a \\ncost premium ranging from zero \\nto 20 cents per square foot for cool \\nroof products. \\n3.3 \\tCosts  \\nA 2006 report (see Table 2) investigated the \\nlikely initial cost ranges for various cool \\nroof products.\\n21 The comparisons in Table \\n2 are indicative of the trade-offs in cost and \\nreflectance and emittance factors between \\ntraditional and cool roof options. For low-\\nsloped roofs, the report noted that: \\n•\\t Cool roof coatings might cost be\\xad\\ntw\\neen $0.75 and $1.50 per square \\nfoot for materials and labor, which \\nincludes routine surface preparation \\nlike pressure-washing, but which does \\nnot include repair of leaks, cracks, or \\nbubbling of the existing roof surface. \\n•\\t Single-ply membrane costs vary from \\n$\\n1.50 to $3.00 per square foot, including \\nmaterials, installation, and reasonable \\npreparation work. This cost does not in\\xad\\nclude extensive repair work or removal \\nand disposal of existing roof layers. \\n•\\t For either type of cool roof, there can \\nb\\ne a cost premium compared to other \\nroofing products. In terms of dollars \\nper square foot, the premium ranges \\nfrom zero to 5 or 10 cents for most \\nproducts, or from 10 to 20 cents for a \\nbuilt-up roof with a cool coating used \\nin place of smooth asphalt or alumi\\xad\\nnum coating. \\n•\\t As with any roofing job, costs depend \\non the local mark\\net and factors such as \\nthe size of the job, the number of roof \\npenetrations or obstacles, and the ease \\nof access to the roof.

Proper installa\\xad\\ntion is important to the long-term success \\nof a cool roof project.

When applied poorly, cool roof coat\\xad\\nings can peel or flake off the roof within \\na couple of years. To ensure good product \\nperformance, building owners can seek ap\\xad\\npropriate warranties for both the product \\nand the installation service. \\nOn steep-sloped roofs, profession\\xad\\nals do not recommend using cool \\ncoatings over existing shingles. This \\ntechnique can cause moisture prob\\xad\\nlems and water damage because the \\ncoating can inhibit normal shingle \\ndrying after rain or dew accumula\\xad\\ntion, allowing water to condense and \\ncollect under the shingles. \\nA key concern for cool roofs is maintain\\xad\\ning their high solar reflectance over time. \\nIf a building’s roof tends to collect large \\namounts of dirt or particulate matter, wash\\xad\\ning the roof according to the manufactur\\xad\\ner’s recommended maintenance procedures \\ncan help retain solar reflectance.

The ad\\xad\\njustment does not apply for roofs with \\nventilated attics or semi-heated spaces. \\n•\\t In January 2003, Chicago amended \\nits ener\\ngy code requirements for low-\\nsloped roofs.36 This code applies to all \\nbuildings except separated buildings \\nthat have minimal peak rates of en\\xad\\nergy use and buildings that are neither \\nheated nor cooled. Low-sloped roofs \\ninstalled on or before December 31, \\n2008, must achieve a minimum solar \\nreflectance (both initial and weathered) \\nof 0.25 when tested in accordance with \\nASTM standards E 903 and E 1918 or \\nby testing with a portable reflectometer \\nat near ambient conditions. For low-\\nsloped roofs installed after that date, \\nroofing products must meet or exceed \\nthe minimum criteria to qualify for the \\nENERGY STAR Roof Products label. \\n•\\t In 2001, in response to electrical power \\nshor\\ntages, California updated its build\\xad\\ning energy code (Title 24), adding cool \\nroofing as an energy efficiency op\\xad\\ntion.\\n37 A cool roof is defined as having \\nminimum solar reflectance of 70 per\\xad\\ncent and minimum thermal emittance \\nof 75 percent, unless it is a concrete \\nor clay tile, in which case it can have \\na minimum solar reflectance of 40 \\npercent. This 40 percent rating incor\\xad\\nporates new cool colored residential \\nproducts. Owners must use specific \\nmethods to verify building energy use \\nto account for cool roofing as an energy \\nefficiency option. In this case, the heat \\nCOOL ROOFS – DRAFT 21',\n",
       " 'gain of the roof is reduced to account \\nfor use of a cool roof. In 2005, these \\ncool roof provisions became mandatory \\nfor all new non-residential construc\\xad\\ntion and re-roofing projects that involve \\nmore than 2,000 square feet (190 m\\n2) \\nor 50 percent replacement. The code \\nalso provides alternatives to the stan\\xad\\ndard criteria as additional compliance \\noptions. In 2006, California began con\\xad\\nsidering planned 2008 updates to Title \\n24 and is studying the possibility of \\nextending cool roof requirements to the \\nsteep-sloped market.\\n38 \\nFor further information on California \\nTitle 24, see <www.energy.ca.gov/ \\nefficiency/blueprint/index.html>. \\nTable 6 lists many of the primary types of \\ncool roof activities. The “Heat Island Re\\xad\\nduction Activities” chapter provides more \\ndetailed examples. \\n6 .  Resources \\n6.1 Cool Roof Energy Savings Calculators \\nFederal agencies have developed two Web-\\nbased calculators that compare energy \\nand cost savings from different cool roof \\ntechnologies for various building types. \\nConsumers also can find calculator tools on \\nWeb sites of cool roof product manufactur\\xad\\ners. All of these tools use different assump\\xad\\ntions and formulas and generate different \\nresults; therefore, they provide a range of \\npotential impacts rather than precise state\\xad\\nments of the savings any individual build\\xad\\ning owner will obtain. \\nFigure 15: Aerial View of Sacramento, \\nCalifornia, with Capitol \\nCalifornia’s Title 24 has accelerated the diffusion \\nof cool roofing across the state. The reflective roof \\nof the capitol in Sacramento and other buildings \\naround Capitol Park stand out among the \\nvegetation, pavement, and darker roofs. \\nGoogle Earth \\nENERGY STAR Roofing Comparison \\nCalculator. The Web-based ENERGY STAR \\nRoofing Comparison Calculator helps to \\nestimate the energy and money that can \\nbe saved by using ENERGY STAR roofing \\nproducts on air-conditioned buildings of at \\nleast 3,000 square feet (280 m\\n2). This cal\\xad\\nculator estimates savings of typical build\\xad\\ning types with non-metallic-surfaced roofs \\nunder typical weather conditions. \\nThis EPA calculator requires input on the \\nage,\\n type, and location of the building; the \\nefficiency of the heating and cooling sys\\xad\\ntems; the local cost of energy; and informa\\xad\\ntion about the roof area, insulation levels, \\nand type of roofing systems used. Based on \\nthese factors, the tool provides an estimate \\nof annual electricity savings in kWh and \\ndollars per 1,000 square feet (93 m\\n2).

       " 'Cool Pavements\\n \\nC\\nool pavements refer to a range of \\nestablished and emerging materials. \\nThese pavement technologies tend to \\nstore less heat and may have lower surface \\ntemperatures compared with conventional \\nproducts. They can help address the prob\\xad\\nlem of urban heat islands, which result in \\npart from the increased temperatures of \\npaved surfaces in a city or suburb. Commu\\xad\\nnities are exploring these pavements as part \\nof their heat island reduction efforts. \\nConventional pavements in the United States \\nare impervious concrete* and asphalt, which \\ncan reach peak summertime surface tem\\xad\\nperatures of 120–150°F (48–67°C).\\n2 These \\nsurfaces can transfer heat downward to be \\nstored in the pavement subsurface, where it \\nis re-released as heat at night. The warmer \\ndaytime surface temperatures also can heat \\nstormwater as it runs off the pavement into \\nlocal waterways.

       " 'Why Have Communities Promoted Cool Roofs More Than Cool \\nPavements? \\nA few decades ago when the concept of using cool roofs and pavements emerged, \\nresearchers focused on radiative properties—surface solar reflectance and thermal \\nemittance—associated with these technologies. Scientists, engineers, and others \\nworked together through the standards-development organization ASTM Interna\\xad\\ntional to create test standards for these properties that could apply to both roofs and \\npavements. (See Section 4.1.) While researchers, industry, and supporters of energy \\nefficiency have helped advance cool roofing into the market, cool pavement has \\nlagged behind. Three factors, which differentiate pavements from roofs, may contrib\\xad\\nute to this difference: \\n1.\\t Pavements are complex. Conditions that affect pavement temperatures, but not \\nroofing materials, include: (a) dirtying and w\\nearing away of a surface due to daily \\nfoot and vehicle traffic, affecting pavement surface properties; (b) convection \\ndue to traffic movement over the pavement; and (c) shading caused by people \\nand cars, vegetation, and neighboring structures and buildings. These factors are \\ndiscussed in Sections 1.2 and 2. \\n2.\\t Pavement temperatures are affected by radiative and thermal characteristics, un\\xad\\nlike cool roofs, where radiativ\\ne properties are the main concern. This is discussed \\nin Section 1.3. \\n3.\\t Pavements serve a variety of functions throughout an urban area. Their uses \\nrange from walking trails to hea\\nvily trafficked highways (unlike cool roofs, which \\ngenerally perform the same function and are off-the-shelf products). Different \\nmaterials and specifications are needed for these different uses, and pavements \\nare often individually specified, making it difficult to define or label a cool pave\\xad\\nment. \\nfurther guide them in the pavement selec\\xad\\ntion process.

       " 'Pavement Surface and Subsurface T emperatures \\nThis chapter mainly focuses on pavement surface temperatures, as most of the cited \\nstudies focus on the surface layer. For conventional pavements, most of the impacts \\nat the surface tend to affect the subsurface similarly. For example, conventional \\npavements with high solar reflectance generally reduce surface and subsurface tem\\nperatures, as less heat is available at the surface to absorb into the pavement. How\\xad\\never, permeable surfaces react differently.  When dry, permeable pavement surface \\ntemperatures may be higher than their impermeable equivalent; but preliminary \\nresearch shows that the subsurface generally is similar to or even cooler than the \\nconventional equivalent, because the permeable layer reduces heat transfer below.\\n11  \\nMore information on subsurface heat transfer is needed to understand the potential \\nheat island impacts because the heat stored in the subsurface may significantly af\\nfect nighttime temperature.

A “-” signals a negative effect; for \\nexample, a technology may lead to higher \\nair temperatures in certain conditions. \\nSlag and Fly Ash Cement \\nSlag and fly ash are sometimes added \\nto concrete to improve its perfor\\xad\\nmance. Slag is a byproduct of pro\\xad\\ncessing iron ore that can be ground \\nto produce cement, and fly ash is \\na byproduct of coal combustion.\\n24 \\nThese materials can make concrete \\nstronger, more resistant to aggressive \\nchemicals, and simpler to place. These \\ncements also reduce material costs \\nand avoid sending wastes to landfills. \\nA key heat island benefit of slag is its \\nlighter color, which can increase the \\nreflectivity of the finished pavement. \\nA 2007 study measured a solar reflec\\xad\\ntance of almost 60 percent for cement \\nwith slag, versus about 35 percent \\nfor a conventional concrete mix.\\n25 In \\ncontrast, fly ash tended to darken con\\xad\\ncrete unless counterbalanced, such as \\nby added slag. However, substituting \\nfly ash for a portion of the Portland \\ncement reduces greenhouse gases and \\nother emissions associated with pro\\xad\\nducing Portland cement. Because of \\nsuch benefits, California’s Department \\nof Transportation typically requires \\nuse of 25 percent fly ash in cement \\nmixtures.\\n26 \\nEffects described in the table do not con\\xad\\nsider magnitude, which may be influenced \\nby local conditions.

       " 'COOL PAVEMENTS – DRAFT  23\\n3 . Benefits and Costs\\nCurrently, few studies provide detailed \\ndata on the benefits and costs of cool \\npavements. This section aims to provide \\na general discussion as a starting point \\nfor decision-makers to consider and gives \\nexamples where available. Again, decision-\\nmakers will also consider location-specific \\nfactors such as functionality of pavements \\nin the local climate, political acceptance, \\nand experience with the technology. Re-\\nsources and examples providing the latest \\ninformation are listed in Sections 4 and 5.\\n3.1 Benefits\\nInstalling cool pavements can be part of \\nan overall strategy to reduce air tempera-\\ntures, which can result in a wide range of \\nbenefits. The information below highlights \\nexisting research in this area. \\nReduced Energy Use \\nAs noted earlier, researchers predicted that \\nif pavement reflectance throughout a city \\nwere increased from 10 to 35 percent, the \\nair temperature could potentially be re-\\nduced by 1°F (0.6°C), which would result in \\nsignificant benefits in terms of lower energy \\nuse and reduced ozone levels. For example, \\nan earlier, separate study estimated over $90 \\nmillion/year in savings from temperature \\nreductions attributed to increased pavement \\nalbedo in the Los Angeles area.\\n39  \\nSimilarly, when permeable pavements \\nevaporate water and contribute to lower \\nair temperatures, they also provide other \\nenergy benefits.\\n40 Permeable pavements \\ncan allow stormwater to infiltrate into \\nthe ground, which decreases stormwater \\nrunoff. With reduced runoff, communities \\nmay realize energy savings associated with \\npumping stormwater and maintaining con-\\nveyance structures. These cost savings may \\nbe significant in areas where there are \\nold, combined sewers (where stormwater \\ndrains into the sanitary sewer system). \\nAir Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\\nDepending on the electric power fuel mix, \\ndecreased energy demand associated with \\ncool pavements will result in lower associ-\\nated air pollution and greenhouse gas emis-\\nsions. Cooler air temperatures also slow the \\nrate of ground-level ozone formation and re-\\nduce evaporative emissions from vehicles. A \\n2007 paper estimated that increasing pave-\\nment albedo in cities worldwide, from an \\naverage of 35 to 39 percent, could achieve \\nreductions in global carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) \\nemissions worth about $400 billion.41 \\nWater Quality and Stormwater Runoff\\nPavements with lower surface tempera-\\ntures—whether due to high solar reflec-\\ntance, permeability, or other factors—can \\nhelp lower the temperature of stormwater \\nrunoff, thus ameliorating thermal shock to \\naquatic life in the waterways into which \\nstormwater drains.\\n42 Laboratory tests with \\nMeasuring Energy Savings \\nfrom Cool Roofs versus \\nCool Pavements\\nMeasuring the energy impacts from a \\ncool roof is relatively easy compared \\nwith quantifying those from pave-\\nment installations. With a roof, one \\ncan measure energy demand before \\nand after the installation, and in a \\ncontrolled experiment, the change in \\ndemand can be associated with the \\nroofing technology. In contrast, pave-\\nments affect building energy demand \\nthrough influencing air temperature, \\nwhich is a more complex relation-\\nship to isolate and measure.',\n",
       " '24  REDUCING URBAN HEAT ISLANDS – DRAFT\\npermeable pavers have shown reductions \\nin runoff temperatures of about 3–7ºF \\n(2–4ºC) in comparison with conventional \\nasphalt paving.\\n43\\nPermeable pavements allow water to \\nsoak into the pavement and soil, thereby \\nreducing stormwater runoff, recharging \\nsoil moisture, and improving water qual-\\nity by filtering out dust, dirt, and pollut-\\nants.\\n44,45 Outdoor testing and laboratory \\nmeasurements have found that permeable \\npavements can reduce runoff by up to \\n90 percent.\\n46 Reducing runoff decreases \\nscouring of streams, and, in areas with \\ncombined sewers, this flow reduction can \\nhelp minimize combined sewer overflows \\nthat discharge sewage and stormwater into \\nreceiving waters. The amount of water \\nthat these pavements collect varies based \\non the type of aggregate used and the po-\\nrosity of the pavements, as well as on the \\nabsorptive ability of the materials support-\\ning the pavement. \\nIncreased Pavement Life and Waste Reduction\\nReducing pavement surface temperatures \\ncan reduce the risk of premature failure of \\nasphalt pavements by rutting (depressions \\nin the wheelpaths) where the combina-\\ntion of slow heavy trucks or buses and hot \\ntemperatures make this a concern. Some \\nfull-scale testing of a typical asphalt pave-\\nment showed that it took 65 times more \\npasses of a truck wheel to rut the pave-\\nment when the temperature just below the \\nsurface was reduced from 120°F (49°C) \\nto 106°F (41°C).\\n47 In general, reducing \\nthe surface temperatures of asphalt pave-\\nments will also slow the rate of “aging” \\nthat contributes to other distresses. For \\nconcrete pavement, reducing daytime sur -\\nface temperatures in locations that experi-\\nence very hot temperatures in the day and \\ncool temperatures at night will reduce the \\ntemperature-related stresses that contrib-\\nute to cracking.\\n48\\n•\\t\\n•\\t\\n•\\t\\nFigure 9: Slag Cement Airport Expansion\\nThe Detroit Metro Airport used 720,000 square \\nfeet (67,000 m 2) of slag cement in an airport \\nterminal expansion project. In this region, the local \\naggregate is susceptible to alkali-silica reaction, \\nwhereas slag resists that form of corrosion \\nbetter than plain cement and is easier to place \\nin hot weather. This approach increased the life \\nexpectancy of the paved surfaces, as well as \\nallowed for the use of a high-albedo product.\\n49 \\nSlag Cement Association\\nQuality of Life Benefits\\nCool pavements may provide additional \\nbenefits, such as:\\nNighttime\\tillumination. Reflective \\npavements can enhance visibility at \\nnight, potentially reducing lighting \\nrequirements and saving money and \\nenergy. European road designers often \\ntake pavement color into account when \\nplanning lighting.\\n50\\nComfort\\timprovements. Using reflec-\\ntive or permeable pavements where \\npeople congregate or children play \\ncan provide localized comfort benefits \\nthrough lower surface and near-surface \\nair temperatures.\\n51\\nSafety.

       " '26  REDUCING URBAN HEA T ISLANDS – DRAFT\\n3.3 Life-Cycle Cost and Environmental \\n       Impact Considerations\\nThe term “life cycle” refers to all the \\nphases of a pavement’s life, from materials \\nproduction through construction, \\nmaintenance, and use, and finishing with \\nthe end-of-life phase where the pavement \\nis rehabilitated, recycled, or removed. \\nTwo types of calculations are typically \\nperformed for a pavement’s life cycle: cost \\nand environmental impact. \\nLife-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) can help \\nin evaluating whether long-term benefits \\ncan outweigh higher up-front costs. Many \\nagencies use LCCA to evaluate pavement \\nstructure options. The Federal Highway \\nAdministration has software for LCCA \\ncalled Real Cost.\\n55,56,57\\nAlthough permeable pavement costs may \\nbe higher than conventional, impermeable \\ntechnologies, these costs are often offset \\nby savings from reduced requirements for \\ngrading, treatment ponds, or other drainage \\nfeatures, such as inlets and stormwater \\npipes.\\n58 For a community, the cumulative \\nreductions in stormwater flows from sites \\ncan provide significant savings in the \\nmunicipal infrastructure. If the community \\nhas combined sewers, there could also be \\nenvironmental, social, and cost benefits \\nfrom reducing combined sewer overflows, \\nas well as potentially avoiding part of the \\nincreased infrastructure costs associated \\nwith combined sewer operation.\\nLife-cycle assessment (LCA) considers the \\nenvironmental impacts throughout the \\nlife of the pavement. The International \\nStandard Organization has published a \\ngeneric LCA guideline for all industrial \\nproducts (the ISO 14040 series of \\ndocuments).\\n59 The National Institute of \\nStandards and Technology has developed \\nBuilding for Environmental and Economic \\nSustainability (BEES), a software tool that \\nuses the ISO 14040 series of standards \\nto estimate life-cycle environmental \\nimpacts from the production and use of \\nasphalt, Portland cement, fly ash cement, \\nand other paving materials in a building \\nenvironment. The BEES software also has \\nan LCCA module.\\n60 Although not directly \\nrelated to urban heat island mitigation, \\nthis tool can help quantify some of the \\nenvironmental and cost impacts from a \\nvariety of pavement choices.\\nLCA for road pavements is a nascent \\nfield. A workshop was held in May 2010 \\nregarding implementation of ISO 14040 \\nfor roads and issues that remain to be \\nresolved.\\n61 LCA has not been used to date \\nto compare the environmental impacts of \\npermeable or reflective versus conventional \\npavement. In general, until more data on \\ncool pavement environmental impacts and \\ncosts exist, communities may need to think \\nbroadly to determine if a cool pavement \\napplication is appropriate. Sustainability \\ninitiatives, in some areas, are motivating \\ncommunities to try cooler alternatives, as \\ndiscussed in Section 4.',\n",
       " 'COOL PAVEMENTS – DRAFT  27\\n4 . Cool Pavement Initiatives\\nThe growing interest in lowering urban \\ntemperatures and designing more sustain-\\nable communities has helped spur activ-\\nity in the cool pavement arena. Most of \\nthe effort has focused on research, due to \\ninformation gaps and the lack of specific \\ndata quantifying cool pavement benefits. \\nMore information on resources and exam-\\nples are provided at the end of this sec-\\ntion and in Section 5. Highlights of some \\ncool pavement efforts are below: \\n•\\t\\n•\\t\\n•\\t\\nArizona\\tState\\tUniversity’s\\tNational\\t\\nCenter\\tof\\tExcellence\\t(NCE)\\tSMART\\t\\nInnovations\\tfor\\tUrban\\tClimate\\tand\\t\\nEnergy.62 This group is studying es-\\ntablished and emerging designs that \\noptimize albedo, emissivity, thermal \\nconductivity, heat storage capacity, and \\ndensity in laboratory and field sites. \\nNCE is developing models, particularly \\nfor the Phoenix area but also beyond, \\nto help decision-makers predict the \\neffects of material properties, shading, \\nand energy use on urban temperatures.\\nThe\\tNational\\tAcademies\\tof\\tScience’ s\\t\\nTransportation\\tResearch\\tBoard\\t\\n(TRB)\\tSubcommittee\\ton\\tPaving\\tMa-\\nterials\\tand\\tthe\\tUrban\\tClimate.

Represen-\\ntatives from the asphalt and concrete \\ntrade associations are participating in \\ncool pavement efforts, such as the TRB \\nSubcommittee on Paving Materials and \\nthe Urban Climate, as well supporting \\nresearch and training related to cool \\npavement. For example, the National \\nAsphalt Pavement Association has been \\ninvestigating high-albedo asphalt pave-\\nments, the National Ready Mixed Con-\\ncrete Association is leading seminars on \\npervious concrete, and the Interlocking \\nConcrete Pavement Institute (ICPI) is \\nproviding professional seminars on per-\\nmeable pavements in cooperation with \\nthe Low Impact Development Center \\nand North Carolina State University.\\n63\\nThese research efforts are expanding op-\\nportunities for identifying, applying, and \\nstudying cool pavement technologies. \\nSustainability or green building initiatives \\nare helping to encourage cool pavement \\ninstallations. \\n•\\t\\n•\\t\\n•\\t\\nEvanston,\\tIllinois, includes permeable \\npavements in its assessment of green \\nbuildings.64 \\nChicago’s\\tGreen\\tAlley\\tprog ram aims \\nto use green construction techniques to \\nrepave over 1,900 miles of alleys, and \\noffers a handbook for installing per-\\nmeable pavements for heat reduction, \\nstormwater management, and other \\nbenefits.\\n65\\nEnvironmental\\trating\\tprograms\\tsuch \\nas Leadership in Energy and Environ-\\nmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, \\nand EarthCraft award points to designs \\nthat incorporate certain permeable \\npavements or pavements of a certain \\nsolar reflectance index.

Refer to the “Heat \\nIsland Reduction Activities” chapter of this \\ncompendium for further examples. \\nAlthough cool pavements are still in their \\ninfancy compared with the other heat \\nisland mitigation strategies—trees and \\nvegetation, green roofs, and cool roofs—\\ninterest and momentum are growing. \\nResearch efforts these past few years have \\ngreatly increased, particularly in the area \\nof permeable pavements. As local and \\nstate transportation and environmental \\nagencies work together to address energy, \\nsustainability, heat-health, and other \\nconcerns, communities can expect to \\nsee more cool pavement installations. \\nActivity in the private sector has also been \\nencouraging, as architects, developers, \\nand others are taking leadership roles in \\nadvancing sustainable technologies. This \\nchapter, which currently provides a starting \\npoint for communities and decision-\\nmakers, will evolve as more information \\nbecomes available. \\nGrowing Concern about \\nSynthetic Turf\\nMany communities have begun to \\nexamine the health impacts from \\nsynthetic turf surfaces, which include \\nthe effects from high temperatures. \\nOne researcher in New York found \\nthat artificial sports fields could be \\nup to 60°F (16°C) hotter than grass, \\npotentially causing skin injuries to \\nathletes as well as contributing to the \\nheat island effect. These data, though \\nnot directly related to pavements, can \\nhelp advance our understanding of \\nhow different materials interact with \\nthe urban climate.\\n66\\nFigure 11: Grass Paving\\nThis 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m 2) parking lot \\noutside a stadium in Houston uses plastic grid \\npavers that allow grass to grow in the open spaces.\\n David Hitchcock, HARC',\n",

       " 'Heat Island Reduction Activities \\nA\\ncross the United States, a diverse group of stakeholders, from government agen\\xad\\ncies to corporations, have advanced urban heat island reduction strategies—urban \\nforestry, green and cool roofs, and cool pavements—to lower summertime tempera\\xad\\ntures and achieve many energy and environmental benefits. Typically heat island mitiga\\xad\\ntion is part of an energy, air quality, water, or sustainability effort,\\n1 and activities range \\nfrom voluntary initiatives, such as cool pavement demonstration projects, to policy actions, \\nsuch as requiring cool roofs via building codes. Some communities have elected to imple\\xad\\nment both voluntary and policy initiatives. These efforts can complement each other, and \\nsometimes an initiative that begins as a voluntary activity becomes required over time. \\nThis chapter draws from the experience of many different groups and covers a range of \\ninitiativ\\nes to highlight a variety of urban heat island reduction activities around the coun\\xad\\ntry. Examples for the following types of activities are included: \\n•\\t Demonstration projects \\n•\\t Incentive programs \\n•\\t Urban forestry programs \\n•\\t Weatherization \\n•\\t Outreach and education \\n•\\t Awards \\n•\\t Procurement \\n•\\t Resolutions \\n•\\t Tree and landscape ordinances \\n•\\t Comprehensive plans and design guidelines \\n•\\t Zoning codes \\n•\\t Green building standards \\n•\\t Building codes \\n•\\t Air quality standards. \\nHeat Island ReductIon actIvItIes – dRaFt 1',\n",
       " 'Heat Island Mitigation \\nStrategies \\nFor more information on heat island \\nreduction strategies, see the corre\\xad\\nsponding chapters of this compendium: \\n“Trees and Vegetation,” “Green Roofs,” \\n“Cool Roofs,” and “Cool Pavements.” \\n1 .\\t Voluntary Efforts \\nMost community strategies to reduce heat \\nislands have relied on voluntary efforts, \\nwhich can generally be grouped into the \\nfollowing categories: \\n•\\t Demonstration projects \\n•\\t Incentive programs \\n•\\t Urban forestry programs \\n•\\t Weatherization \\n•\\t Outreach and education \\n•\\t Awards. \\nMany groups choose to conduct just \\none kind of ac\\ntivity; others combine ap\\xad\\nproaches. For example, some utilities have \\nfocused on cool roof rebates to encourage \\nconsumers to install reflective roofing prod\\xad\\nucts. Some local environment departments \\nhave sponsored demonstration projects, \\nconducted outreach and education efforts \\nto publicize results, and have provided \\ngrants to support use of mitigation tech\\xad\\nnologies by residents and industry. \\n1.1 \\tDemonstration Projects \\nLocal governments, universities, and other \\norganizations have used projects to demon\\xad\\nstrate a specific heat island mitigation strat\\xad\\negy and quantify its benefits in a controlled \\nenvironment. Documenting the project \\nand its results can provide the data and \\npublicity needed to develop larger initia\\xad\\ntiv\\nes, promote new technologies and help \\nget them to market, and sometimes even \\nencourage local economic development. \\n(See the “Stimulating Local Economies and \\nBusinesses” textbox.) \\nCommunities have found heat island dem\\xad\\nonstr\\nation projects to be most effective \\nwhen they: \\n•\\t Target high-visibility projects. F ocus\\xad\\ning efforts on a prominent building or \\nsite helps attract attention to heat island \\nmitigation efforts. \\n•\\t Measure benefi\\n ts.  Highlighting antici\\xad\\npated benefits and collecting data on \\nactual impacts provides useful informa\\xad\\ntion for planning future activities. These \\nbenefits also illustrate to others the \\nreasons and means to act. \\n•\\t Conv\\ney lessons learned. Documenting \\nhow demonstration projects are con\\xad\\nducted makes them easier to replicate \\nand improve. \\nLead By Example \\n“Lead by example” programs involve \\nimplementing strategies within lo\\xad\\ncal and state government facilities, \\noperations, and fleets, where appro\\xad\\npriate. These programs offer energy, \\nenvironmental, and financial benefits \\nwhile creating an important opportu\\xad\\nnity for governments to demonstrate \\nthe economic feasibility of the strate\\xad\\ngies they are promoting. This lead\\xad\\nership can raise public awareness \\nof the benefits of urban heat island \\nreduction strategies, which can lead \\nto increased public and private sector \\nsupport for advancing them. \\nReducInG uRBan Heat Islands – dRaFt 2',\n",
       " 'A variety of organizations can be the chief \\nagents of change and the first to test alter\\xad\\nnative technologies, often in highly visible, \\npublic facilities. Demonstration projects \\nhave taken place in parks, schools, and mu\\xad\\nnicipal buildings like city hall. These proj\\xad\\nects often also monitor costs and benefits, \\nsuch as energy savings. Examples include: \\n•\\t Chicago installed a green roof on its \\ncity hall\\n that includes 20,000 plants, \\nshrubs, grasses, vines, and trees. The \\ncity expects to save directly more than \\n9,270 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year of \\nelectricity and nearly 740 million British \\nthermal units (Btu) per year of natural \\ngas for heating. This energy savings \\ntranslates into about $3,600 annually, \\nand savings will increase with higher \\nenergy prices. In addition to assess\\xad\\ning energy impacts, the green roof has \\nbeen designed to test different types of \\nrooftop garden systems, success rates \\nof native and non-native vegetation, \\nand reductions in stormwater runoff. \\nThis city hall green roof has helped to \\nraise the visibility of green roofs and to \\nincrease public understanding of them. \\nChicago’s Department of Environment \\nstaff has frequently given presentations \\nabout the roof, which has won numer\\xad\\nous awards. For further information, go \\nto <http://egov.city ofchicago.org> and \\nlook under the Depar\\ntment of Environ\\xad\\nment’s City Hall green roof project. \\n•\\t A demonstration project for Tucson \\ndocumented ho\\nw a cool roof re\\xad\\nduced temperatures inside and on \\nthe roof of the building and saved \\nmore than 400 million Btu annually \\nin energy. A white elastomeric coating \\nwas installed over a 28,000-square foot \\n(2,600 m\\n2), unshaded metal roof on \\none of the city’s administration build\\xad\\nings. Following the installation, energy \\nsavings were calculated at 50 to 65 \\nFigure 1: Chicago City Hall Green Roof \\nChicago’s commitment to green roofs includes \\ndemonstration projects, such as on its City Hall, \\neducation, incentives, and policy actions. \\nKatrin Barth-Scholz/Department of Energy \\nStimulating Local \\nEconomies and Businesses \\nThe non-profit group Sustainable \\nSouth Bronx has developed several \\ngoals for the green roof/cool roof \\ndemonstration project on top of its \\noffice building in Hunts Point. These \\ngoals include gathering research on \\nlocal benefits, establishing a resource \\nfor the community, educating New \\nYorkers on the value of green roofs, \\nand advocating sustainable building \\npractices. The demonstration project \\nhas become a springboard for de\\xad\\nveloping a local green and cool roof \\ninstallation company to provide em\\xad\\nployment opportunities in the South \\nBronx area.

Incentives from governments, \\nutilities, and other organizations can in\\xad\\nclude below-market loans, tax breaks, \\nproduct rebates, grants, and giveaways. For \\nexample: \\n•\\t Since 2006, Baltimore County’s Gro\\n w\\xad\\ning Home Campaign has provided \\n$10 coupons to homeowners toward \\nthe purchase of most trees at local \\nnurseries. Each coupon represents $5 of \\npublic funds and $5 of retail funds. In \\norder to validate their coupons, hom\\xad\\neowners provide information including \\ntree type and location planted, which \\nallows the county to integrate the data \\nwith future tree canopy studies. The \\ncounty began the program as an in\\xad\\nnovative way to increase tree canopy \\ncover as part of its larger “Green Re\\xad\\nnaissance” forest conservation and sus\\xad\\ntainability plan. In the first two months \\nof the program, 1,700 trees were plant\\xad\\ned. See <http://fpum.org/pdf/MD%20 \\nmanaging_forest_resources.pdf> and \\n<www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agen\\xad\\ncies/environment/growinghome/index. \\nhtml> for further information. \\n•\\t Since 1990, the Sacramento Mu\\xad\\nnicipal Utility Distric\\nt (SMUD) has \\npartnered with the Sacramento Tree \\nFoundation to provide more than \\n350,000 free shade trees to residents \\nin the Sacramento area. This program \\nencourages residents to strategically \\nplant vegetation around their homes \\nto reduce energy consumption. Homes \\nwith an eastern, western, or south\\xad\\nern e\\nxposure that heats up during the \\nsummer are eligible for this program. \\nSMUD provides trees between four \\nand seven feet tall (1.2-2.2 m), as well \\nas stakes, ties, fertilizer, tree delivery, \\nand expert advice on tree selection \\nand planting techniques free of charge. \\nHomeowners must agree to plant and \\ncare for the trees. See <www.smud.org/ \\nresidential/trees/index.html> for more \\ninfor\\nmation. SMUD also offers rebates \\nto residential customers who use cool \\nroofing technologies. The utility offers a \\n20-cent-per-square-foot (0.09 m\\n2) rebate \\nto customers who own single-family, \\nmulti-family, or mobile homes with flat \\nroofs and who install ENERGY STAR\\n® \\ncool roof products. \\n•\\t After the success of its green roof dem\\xad\\nonstr\\nation project, Chicago established \\ngreen and cool roof grant programs. \\nThe green roof program cites the ability \\nof green roofs to “create energy savings \\nfor building,” “lower surrounding urban \\nheat temperatures,” and “reduce storm \\nwater runoff, improve water quality, and \\ncreate conditions for longer-lasting roof \\nsystems.” Similarly, the city recognizes \\ncool roofs “not only help reduce cooling \\ncosts, but can also have a positive envi\\xad\\nronmental impact by reducing the urban \\nheat island effect.” In 2005, its first year, \\nthe program supported 20 green roof \\ninstallation projects; in 2006, it helped \\nfund 40. In the fall of 2007, the city an\\xad\\nnounced that it was expanding the pro\\xad\\ngram to include cool roofs and expected \\nto provide about 55 $6,000 grants. \\nRecipients can use grants for residential, \\ncommercial, or industrial buildings. See \\n<http://egov.cityofchicago.org/>, under \\nthe Department of Environment portion \\nof the website,\\n for more information. \\nReducInG uRBan Heat Islands – dRaFt 4',\n",
       " '•\\t The Pennsylvania Department of \\nEnvironmental Protection’s Energy \\nHarvest Program has been providing \\ngrants for specific energy saving proj\\xad\\nects since 2003. In 2007, it dispensed \\nmore than $500,000 to green roof \\nprojects across the state. The Energy \\nHarvest Program overall aims to deploy \\ninnovative technologies and encourages \\n“proposals that are market-driven, create \\njobs, and produce economic develop\\xad\\nment within the Commonwealth.” See \\nEnergy Harvest Program information \\navailable at: <www.depweb.state.pa.us/ \\nenergy/site/default.asp>. \\n•\\t In addition to green roofs, building \\no\\nwners can also install vertical gar\\xad\\ndens—sometimes referred to as green \\nor living walls—on exterior walls to \\nshade buildings and provide evapo\\xad\\ntranspiration.\\n2 The Houston Down\\xad\\ntown Management District (HDMD) \\nVertical Gardens Matching Grant \\ninitiative first gave grants in 2007 \\nto encourage plantings that cover \\nwalls. The grants also support excep\\xad\\ntional landscaping that adds significant \\nevapotranspiration and shade for blank \\nwalls, parking garages, and sidewalks. \\nThe program goals include improving \\noverall aesthetics, pedestrian comfort, \\nair quality, and reducing the heat island \\neffect. Grants cannot exceed half of the \\ntotal project cost or $20,000, and contri\\xad\\nbutions can be in kind. Tenants, prop\\xad\\nerty owners, and registered non-profits \\ncan all apply. See <www.houston\\xad\\ndowntown.com/Home/Business/Do\\xad\\ningBusiness/ De\\nvelopmentAssistance/ \\nDevelopment%20Assistance.PDF>. \\n•\\t Since 2002, A ustin Energy has given \\n10-cent-per-square-foot rebates for \\ncool roof installations. Customers \\nmust use cool roof products that have \\na minimum reflectivity of 75 percent, \\nand the project must pass a cost-benefit \\nanalysis. The utility has been promoting \\ncool roof produc\\nts as a cost-effective \\nand low-risk approach to reducing \\ncooling loads and peak demand. As of \\n2005, Austin Energy had awarded more \\nthan $164,000 as rebates, represent\\xad\\ning more than 1.5 million square feet \\n(140,000 m\\n2) of roof area and saving \\nan estimated 1.25 million kWh of en\\xad\\nergy. See <www.austinenergy.com/En\\xad\\nergy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/ \\nindex.htm> for more information. \\nEnergy Incentives \\nThe Database of State Incentives for \\nRenewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) \\nprovides current information on \\nstate, local, utility, and select federal \\nincentives that promote renewable \\nenergy and energy efficiency.  Some \\nof the incentives listed, particularly \\nthose that involve energy efficiency \\nand green building practices, include \\nheat island reduction strategies.  See \\n<www.dsireusa.org>. \\n1.3 \\tUrban Forestry Programs \\nUrban forestry or tree planting programs \\nexist in most large cities and counties in \\nthe United States. These programs gener\\xad\\nally have broad goals that emphasize the \\nmultiple benefits trees can provide, includ\\xad\\ning helping to cool cities. Most of these \\nprograms unite diverse stakeholders, and \\ntheir efforts range from short-term, one\\xad\\ntime projects to long-term community \\nrevitalization. Moreover, many states give \\ngrants to communities and organizations \\nthat promote or maintain urban forests. For \\nexample, Wisconsin will disburse $530,000 \\nin roughly 40 grants in 2008 as part of a \\nprogram it has operated since 1993; South \\nDakota has run a similar program since \\nHeat Island ReductIon actIvItIes – dRaFt 5',\n",
       " '1991.3,4 As of early 2008, the Washington \\nState legislature was working on several \\nbills that would support and expand local \\nurban forestry efforts in recognition of how \\nurban trees and vegetation improve air \\nquality, reduce temperatures, enhance qual\\xad\\nity of life, and reduce and filter stormwater \\nrunoff.\\n5 \\nFrequently, urban afforestation focuses on \\nlow-income communities, where tree cover \\nis sparse. For example: \\n•\\t The Pennsylvania Department of \\nConser\\nvation and Natural Resources \\noversees a project called TreeVitalize, \\nwhich brings together county and local \\ngovernments, foundations, trade asso\\xad\\nciations,\\n and private industry to restore \\ntree cover in the southeastern part of \\nthe state. TreeVitalize aims to plant \\nmore than 20,000 trees in approximate\\xad\\nly 40 neighborhoods in Bucks, Chester, \\nDelaware, Montgomery, and Philadel\\xad\\nphia counties. The $8 million program \\ntargets neighborhoods in older cities, \\nboroughs, and townships in which tree \\ncover is below 25 percent. See <www. \\ntreevitalize.net/> for more information. \\n•\\t Ground\\n work Elizabeth, a nonprofit \\ngroup in Elizabeth, New Jersey, works \\nto involve neighborhood residents \\nin community revitalization projects, \\nTree Maintenance and  Education \\nMany urban forestry programs explain that it is easy to plant trees but difficult to \\nmaintain them, particularly until they become well established.  In order to ensure \\nmost trees survive, programs have enlisted and empowered volunteers to care for \\ntrees until they are established.  Community participation is important because most \\nurban trees are not under public jurisdiction. \\nOften tree planting programs train participants in proper tree planting techniques \\nand care.\\n  In Pennsylvania, TreeVitalize provides nine hours of classroom and field \\ntraining to community residents who want to become urban forestry leaders. The \\nclasses cover tree identification, planting, pruning, mulching, tree biology/physiol\\xad\\nogy, proper species selection, community tree care, and proper pruning.  Residents \\nalso can learn how to organize community-assisted tree planting projects.

Weatherization usually involves \\nmaking the homes of qualifying residents, \\ngenerally low-income families, more en\\xad\\nergy efficient at no cost to the residents. \\nStates use weatherization funds provided \\nby the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) \\nWeatherization Assistance Program to help \\nrecipients cover heating bills and invest in \\nenergy efficiency actions that lower costs. \\nStates can also use the funds to install cool\\xad\\ning efficiency measures, such as screening \\nand shading devices. \\nThe Energy Coordinating Agency (ECA) \\nof Philadelphia,\\n which administers the \\ncity’s weatherization services, has applied \\ncool roof coatings as part of its package \\nof energy efficiency treatments. Through \\nits Cool Homes Program, more than 550 \\nresidences in the Philadelphia area have \\nhad their roofs coated. ECA commissioned \\na study that found the cool coatings and \\nincreased insulation eliminated 90 percent \\nof the heat gain through the ceiling, reduc\\xad\\ning top-floor ceiling temperatures by an \\naverage of 4.7°F (2.6°C) and chest-height \\ntemperatures by 2.4°F (1.3°C). These re\\xad\\nduced temperatures lowered air condition\\xad\\ning loads by about one-third in a typical \\nrowhouse.\\n6 See <www.ecasavesenergy.org/ \\nses/whiteroof/roof-coolhomes.html> for \\nmore inf\\normation. \\nHeat Health—An \\nOpportunity to Advance \\nHeat Island Mitigation \\nStrategies \\nSeveral large cities have developed \\nprograms to minimize health impacts \\nfrom excessive heat events. These \\nefforts provide an opportunity to \\neducate communities about urban \\nheat islands and promote heat is\\xad\\nland reduction strategies, particularly \\nshade tree planting and cool roof \\napplications, as a long-term miti\\xad\\ngation or adaptation strategy.  For \\nexample, Philadelphia has long been \\nconcerned with reducing heat-related \\nmortality. The city was the first in \\nthe United States to implement a \\nHeat Health Watch-Warning System, \\nwhich has become a worldwide \\nmodel for heat wave forecasting. \\nWhen the Philadelphia Public Health \\nDepar\\ntment educates citizens about \\nexcessive heat events and immedi\\xad\\nate counter-measures, such as using \\ntelephone heat hotlines and taking \\nadvantage of public air-conditioned \\nbuildings, or “cooling centers,” it also \\nprovides them information about \\nlonger-term heat island reduction \\nstrategies. \\nEPA’s Excessive Heat Events Guidebook \\ne\\nxplains how local public health of\\xad\\nficials and others can assess their vul\\xad\\nnerability and develop and implement \\nnotification and response programs. \\nSee <www.epa.gov/heatisland/about/ \\nheatguidebook.html>. \\nHeat Island ReductIon actIvItIes – dRaFt 7',\n",

See <www.treeutah.org/ \\nstatewide.htm> for more information. \\nFurther, the Utah State Energy Program, \\nUtah Depar\\ntment of Natural Resources, and \\nthe National Energy Foundation worked \\ntogether to create the Utah Kool Kids pro\\xad\\ngram to teach elementary and secondary \\nage students about urban heat islands, \\ntheir impacts on energy and air qual\\xad\\nity\\n, and heat island reduction strategies. \\nThe program gives teachers lesson plans, \\noverheads, test questions, experiments, \\nand research tools to engage students. See \\n<http://www.nef1.org/ea/kool.html> for \\nmore inf\\normation. \\nSome outreach and education programs \\nf\\nocus specifically on reaching students. The \\nCool Schools program in Los Angeles \\nteaches students to become environ\\xad\\nmental ste\\nwards through hands-on and \\nclassroom experience. Through the proj\\xad\\nect, students have helped plant hundreds \\nof trees around Los Angeles schools. Cool \\nSchools creates an opportunity to teach \\nlessons on biology, botany, horticulture, \\nand related topics. See <www.ladwp.com/ \\nladwp/cms/ladwp001087.jsp>. \\n1.6 \\tAwards \\nGovernments, community groups, and \\ncorporations have rewarded exemplary \\nwork as a way to highlight innovation and \\npromote solutions to mitigate heat islands \\nacross the public and private sectors. Ex\\xad\\namples of award programs include: \\n•\\t Home Depot Foundation’s Awards \\nof Ex\\ncellence for Community Trees. \\nSince 2005, this foundation has rec\\xad\\nognized public/priv\\nate collaborations \\nfor their leadership and development \\nof successful tree planting initiatives. \\nWinning projects in large and small city \\ncategories receive $75,000 and runners-\\nup receive $25,000.

A number of these actions have \\nhelped remove barriers or provide incen\\xad\\ntives for implementing mitigation strate\\xad\\ngies. Others have prescribed minimum \\nrequirements, especially for new construc\\xad\\ntion. Policy efforts can include: \\n•\\t Procurement \\n•\\t Resolutions \\n•\\t Tree and landscape ordinances \\n•\\t Comprehensive plans and design \\nguidelines \\n•\\t Zoning codes \\n•\\t Green building standards \\n•\\t Building codes \\n•\\t Air quality standards. \\n2.1 \\tProcurement \\nMany local governments interested in \\nmitigating heat islands started by procuring \\ncool technologies for municipal buildings. \\nSince state and local governments usually \\nput construction work and material sup\\xad\\nplies out for bid, they can revise bid speci\\xad\\nfications to include cool products. \\nFor example, T\\n ucson, Arizona, requires \\nthat air-conditioned city facilities use \\ncool roofing materials for most new con\\xad\\nstruction and roof replacements. The city \\nrevised its general bid criteria to ensure \\nthat materials used are equivalent to those \\non the ENERGY STAR Roofing Products list. \\nWhen a local government requires contrac\\xad\\ntors to use cool products in this manner, it \\nbecomes easier to encourage additional use \\nof these products on private projects. \\nAfter successfully demonstrating the use \\nof per\\nmeable pavements, Chicago began \\na Green Alley initiative that encourages \\nuse of porous paving whenever an alley \\nneeds to be re-paved. Forty-six alleys were \\nrenovated under this initiative in 2007, and \\nultimately, almost 2,000 miles of alleyways \\nwill be made permeable.

See <www.annapolis.gov/upload/ \\nimages/government/council/Adopted/ \\nR3806.pdf> for more information. \\n2.3 Tree and Landscape Ordinances \\nMany local governments have enacted \\ntree and landscape ordinances, which can \\nensure public safety, protect trees or views, \\nand provide shade. Three types of ordi\\xad\\nnances, in particular, are most useful from \\na heat island perspective: tree protection, \\nstreet trees, and parking lot shade. \\nReducInG uRBan Heat Islands – dRaFt 10',\n",
       " 'Tree Protection \\nTree protection ordinances prohibit the \\nremoval or pruning of trees without a per\\xad\\nmit. Often, these ordinances apply only to \\nnative trees or trees with historical signifi\\xad\\ncance. The effectiveness of this type of pro\\xad\\nvision depends on enforcement and how \\nstrict the requirements are for granting tree \\nremoval permits. \\nSome ordinances protect not only trees \\nbut also the ground under the cro\\nwn area \\nof a tree to prevent root damage. An ordi\\xad\\nnance in Atlanta, Georgia, for example, \\nrequires that at least 16 square feet (1.5 \\nm\\n2) of soil around the tree must remain \\nunpaved and open to the air. Toxic chemi\\xad\\ncals also must be kept away from the trees. \\nThese ordinances are less common than \\nthose that simply restrict removal. \\nAnother approach, often linked to a local \\ngo\\nvernment’s subdivision or development \\ncode, is protecting tree stands during new \\nconstruction. In this case, developers are \\nrequired to preserve tree stands during site \\ndesign and protect them once construction \\ncommences. The ordinances can require \\nprotection based on the percentage of a \\nsite, or a minimum point value, with larger, \\nmature trees earning more points. \\nAnnapolis, Maryland, explicitly recog\\xad\\nnized the environmental v\\nalue of trees \\nand acted to protect them during con\\xad\\nstruction. The “Tree Protection Ordinance” \\nrequires a survey of trees on a proposed \\ndevelopment site and fences or other \\nmeans to mark and protect designated \\ntrees during construction. The ordinance \\nalso prohibits certain activities, such as \\ntrenching or grading, within the dripline \\nof trees, unless specific precautions are fol\\xad\\nlowed. More information on this ordinance \\nis available under §17.09 City Code at \\n<http://bpc.iserver.net/codes/annapolis/>. \\nFigure 4: Fences Protect a Tree During \\nConstruction \\nFences can protect not just a tree’s trunk and \\nbranches, but also its root system during \\nconstruction. \\nTLCforTrees \\nSan Antonio, Texas, requires different \\nlevels of tree protection based on tree \\nclass or location. The ordinance classifies \\nsignificant trees, heritage trees, and trees \\nwithin the 100-year floodplain. For exam\\xad\\nple, heritage trees (defined, for most spe\\xad\\ncies, as trees 24 inches [60 cm] or greater in \\ndiameter at breast height [DBH]), must be \\npreserved. The ordinance, however, gener\\xad\\nally counts total tree diameter-inches at a \\nsite, not individual trees, and gives flex\\xad\\nibility in preservation: up to 90 percent of \\nthe tree-diameter-inches can be considered \\npreserved if the developer plants an equal \\nor greater number of tree-diameter-inches \\nelsewhere. Developers can also fulfill the \\npreservation requirement by contributing \\nto the city’s tree fund. For details, see the \\nordinance and its amendments at <http:// \\nepay.sanantonio.gov/dsddocumentcentral/ \\nupload/2003%20Tree%20Preservation%20 \\nOrdinance.pdf> and <http://epa y.sananto\\xad\\nnio.gov/dsddocumentcentral/upload/Re\\xad\\nvised%20Tree%20Amend%2011-06.pdf>. \\nStreet Trees \\nStreet tree ordinances generally govern \\nho\\nw to plant and remove trees along pub\\xad\\nlic rights-of-way and land that is privately \\nHeat Island ReductIon actIvItIes – dRaFt 11',\n",

More effective street tree policies \\ninclude guidelines on tree selection, instal\\xad\\nlation, and maintenance to lengthen a street \\ntree’s life and minimize problems with pave\\xad\\nment, electrical wires, and buildings. \\nFor example, Orlando, Florida, specifies \\nthat trees must be planted along both \\nsides of a street, with one tree every 50 to \\n100 feet (15-30 m). The selected trees must \\neventually be capable of reaching a mini\\xad\\nmum height of 40 feet (12 m) and a crown \\nspread of 30 feet (9 m). The ordinance is \\navailable at <www.municode.com/resourc\\xad\\nes/gateway.asp?sid=9&pid=13349>. \\nSeattle requires a street use permit be\\xad\\nf\\nore landscaping in a planting strip in \\na public right-of-way. For street trees, the \\nstrip must be at least 5 feet (1.5 m) wide, \\nunless specific approval from the city’s \\narborist is received. Five feet is generally \\nrecommended as the minimum width for \\nplanting most trees. A guide is available to \\nhelp property owners select and plant trees \\nin accordance with the city’s requirements. \\nSee <www.seattle.gov/trasportation/tree\\xad\\nplanting.htm> for further information. \\nParking Lot Shade \\nSome communities require parking lots be \\nshaded to cool pa\\nvement and cars, which \\nincreases comfort, reduces the heat island \\neffect, and lowers evaporative emissions \\nfrom parked cars. For example, since 1983, \\nan ordinance in Sacramento’s zoning \\ncode has required that enough trees be \\nplanted to shade 50 percent of ne\\nw, or \\nsignificantly altered, parking lots after 15 \\nyears of tree growth.

The ordinance \\napplies to most new building construc\\xad\\ntion, as well as to repairs, remodeling, and \\nenlargements of a particular size and cost. \\nThe Bureau of Forestry, which maintains \\nthe standards, must inspect and approve all \\nparkway vegetation prior to planting.

For \\nexample, a 10,000-square-foot (465 m\\n2) site \\nwith 600 square feet (55 m2) of storefront \\nand 150 parking spaces would require 20 \\nshade trees (i.e., four for the square footage \\nof the site, one for the store frontage, and 15 \\nfor the parking lot).

Comprehensive \\nplans, sometimes called general plans in \\nCalifornia and other states, are adopted by \\na legislative body of a local government, \\nand set forth policies, goals, and objectives \\nto direct development and conservation \\nthat occurs within its planning jurisdiction. \\nThey generally have a broad scope and \\nlong-term vision. Design guidelines provide \\na connection between general planning \\npolicies and implementing regulations, \\nsuch as zoning codes and subdivision regu\\xad\\nlations. Design guidelines convey a sense \\nof the preferred quality for a place by be\\xad\\ning descriptive and suggestive. \\nThe “Environmental Planning Element” \\nin the Gilber\\nt, Arizona, general plan lists \\nmitigating heat islands as a core goal. \\nSpecific policies under the goal include: \\n1) de\\nveloping criteria that will identify \\nprojects that might contribute to the heat \\nisland effect and will require an evalua\\xad\\ntion of mitigation techniques; 2) seeking \\nsponsors such as educational institutions, \\nutility companies, and government entities \\nto promote heat island a\\nwareness among \\nlandowners, developers, engineers, and ar\\xad\\nchitects; and 3) promoting design concepts \\nusing engineered green space to maximize \\nshading of surfaces that tend to heat up, \\npromote education and awareness of cool \\nroof materials and construction techniques, \\nand promote alternative pavement technol\\xad\\nogies in parking areas. For more informa\\xad\\ntion see <www.ci.gilbert.az.us/generalplan/ \\nchapter07.cfm>. \\nDesign guidelines can take a holistic ap\\xad\\nproach to heat island mitigation or spe\\n\\xad\\ncific mitigation strategies. For example, \\nToronto’s Official Plan includes policies \\nt\\no reduce the urban heat island and \\nachieve a wide range of environmen\\xad\\ntal gains. As part of that plan, the city \\nreleased draft parking lot guidelines in \\nNovember 2007 that call for shade trees, \\npermeable and reflective pavements, and \\nother design features to manage stormwa\\xad\\nter, reduce energy consumption, and lower \\nurban temperatures.\\n11 \\nThe town of Highland, Utah, created a mas\\xad\\nter plan for a 50-acre (200,000 m\\n2) overlay \\nzone to be privately developed as a town \\nFigure 6: Portland Eco-Roof \\nThe Portland Bureau of Environmental Services \\n(BES) has a green roof on its headquarters.

The city design guidelines for the \\nzone recommended several heat island miti\\xad\\ngation elements, including reflective roofing, \\nreflective parking lot surfaces, and landscap\\xad\\ning. Those guidelines were then adopted into \\nthe zoning requirements for the town center. \\nIn contrast, P\\n ortland, Oregon, has focused \\non the use of eco-roofs in the city center \\ndistrict, primarily for their aesthetic and \\nstormwater management benefits. Design \\nguidelines call for integrating vegetated roofs \\ninto central city projects. As discussed in \\nthe next section, Portland has taken specific \\nsteps in its zoning code to achieve this result. \\n2.5 Zoning Codes \\nZoning codes implement the goals and \\nobjectives of a comprehensive plan. These \\nregulations generally dictate function for an \\narea, building height and bulk, population \\ndensity, and parking requirements. Zoning \\ncodes can also promote heat island mitiga\\xad\\ntion strategies in various ways. For example, \\nas noted in Section 2.3, cities such as Sac\\xad\\nramento have adopted parking lot shading \\nrequirements as part of their zoning codes. \\nCommunities have also allowed density \\nbonuses f\\nor construction that adopts mitiga\\xad\\ntion strategies. In 2001, Portland, Oregon, \\nmodified its zoning code to include an \\n“eco-roof development bonus” for devel\\xad\\nopers to install rooftop gardens or “eco\\xad\\nroofs.” In Title 33 of the Zoning Code there \\nis a floor area ratio bonus for projects that \\ninstall eco-roofs in Portland’s central district. \\nThe bonus amount depends on the extent \\nof the eco-roof coverage. If the eco-roof cov\\xad\\ners 60 percent or more of the roof surface, \\ndevelopers can build an additional 3 square \\nfeet (0.3 m\\n2) for each square foot of green \\nroof. If the green roof covers a lower per\\xad\\ncent of the surface, the bonus is reduced. \\nSee Section 33.510 of the code at <www. \\nportlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image. \\ncfm?id=53363> for specific information. \\nChicago also has a similar provision, \\nwith the floor area ratio density bonus \\nbased on the amount b\\ny which a green \\nroof exceeds 50 percent of the roof surface. \\n2.6 Green Building Programs and Standards \\nGreen building initiatives place a high pri\\xad\\nority on human and environmental health \\nand resource conservation over the life \\ncycle of a building. Many local, state, and \\nfederal governments have adopted green \\nbuilding programs, or standards, that cap\\xad\\nture heat island reduction strategies. \\nFor example, local governments such as \\nArlington, Virginia, and San Jose, Cali\\xad\\nf\\nornia,12 are basing their municipal green \\nbuilding requirements on the U.S. Green \\nBuilding Council (USGBC) Leadership in \\nEnergy and Environmental Design (LEED) \\nRating System™. Green Globes, operated \\nby the Green Building Initiative (GBI) in \\nthe United States, is another rating system \\nthat communities are using. The Canadian \\ngovernment requires all federal buildings to \\nmeet the Canadian version of Green Globes, \\nGo Green and Go Green Plus. States like \\nArkansas and Maryland recognize both \\nLEED and Green Globes in their green \\nbuilding initiatives. Under both rating sys\\xad\\ntems, buildings can earn credits towards \\ncertification by providing shade vegetation, \\ninstalling cool or green roofs, and using \\nhighly reflective and emissive pavements or \\npermeable paving products, all measures that \\nreduce the heat island effect. \\nSpecific to homes, programs such as Earth-\\nCr\\naft House, created by the Greater Atlanta \\nHome Builders Association and Southface \\nEnergy Institute, award points for resi\\xad\\ndences that preserve and plant trees, install \\nENERGY STAR cool roof products, or use \\npermeable pavement. In addition, EarthCraft \\nHouses must meet ENERGY STAR certifica\\xad\\ntion. Communities from Virginia to Florida \\nhave constructed EarthCraft homes. \\nReducInG uRBan Heat Islands – dRaFt 14',\n",
       " 'Seattle Green Factor \\nSeattle has adopted minimum landscape requirements, known as the Seattle Green \\nFactor, for new developments in commercial areas in the city. This program requires \\nthat, as of late January 2007, certain new developments in neighborhood business \\ndistricts must provide for vegetative cover on the equivalent of 30 percent of the ap\\xad\\nplicable property. The regulations apply to developments with more than four dwell\\xad\\ning units, more than 4,000 square feet (370 m\\n2) of commercial uses, or more than \\n20 new parking spaces.  Developers can use a menu of strategies, including planting \\nnew trees, preserving trees, and installing green roofs and green walls to meet this \\ntarget. The regulations are part of the city’s Commercial Code and encourage plant\\xad\\ning of layers of vegetation and larger trees in areas visible to the public. The rules \\nalso include bonuses for harvesting rain water and choosing plants that need less \\nwater. The city has developed a worksheet to help applicants calculate a “score” that \\nindicates whether various mixes of landscaping measures meet the requirements, \\nwhich will allow developers to try different combinations of features.

ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Stan\\xad\\ndard 90.1-1999, Energy Standards for \\nBuildings Except Low-Rise Residential \\nBuildings, and ANSI/ASHRAE Stan\\xad\\ndard 90.2-2001, Energy-Efficient De\\xad\\nsign of Low-Rise Residential Buildings, \\nprovide guidelines for new equip\\xad\\nment, systems, and buildings. These \\nstandards originally were developed \\nin response to the 1970s energy crisis \\nand now include credits pertaining \\nto cool roofing.  For example, Adden\\xad\\ndum f to 90.2-2001 allows high-albedo \\nroofs in hot and humid climates as \\npart of the energy efficiency ceiling \\ncalculation for a residential building. \\ninsulation level if a cool roof with a 75 \\npercent minimum solar refl\\nectance and \\n75 percent minimum thermal emittance \\nis installed.\\n13 Note that if building own\\xad\\ners install a cool roof and simultane\\xad\\nously reduce insulation, there may be \\nno net energy savings. \\n•\\t Flor\\nida also gives cool roofs credit \\nin its building energy code. Buildings \\nusing a roof with 70 percent minimum \\nsolar reflectance and 75 percent mini\\xad\\nmum thermal emittance are eligible \\nto reduce the amount of insulation \\nneeded to meet building efficiency \\nstandards, as long as a radiant barrier \\nReducInG uRBan Heat Islands – dRaFt 16',\n",
       " 'is not also installed in the roof plenum \\nor attic space. \\n•\\t In response to electrical power shortag\\xad\\nes, Calif\\nornia added cool roofs as an \\nenergy efficiency option to its build\\xad\\ning energy code (Title 24) in 2001. The \\ncode defines a cool roof as having a \\nminimum solar reflectance of 70 per\\xad\\ncent and minimum thermal emittance of \\n75 percent, unless it is concrete or clay \\ntile, in which case it can have a mini\\xad\\nmum solar reflectance of 40 percent. \\nThis 40-percent rating incorporates new \\ncool-colored residential products into \\nthe standard. In 2005, these cool roof \\nprovisions became mandatory require\\xad\\nments for all new non-residential con\\xad\\nstruction and re-roofing projects that \\ninvolve more than 2,000 square feet \\n(180 m\\n2) or 50 percent replacement.14 \\nThe code allows owners to meet these \\nrequirements in a variety of ways. \\n–\\t The simplest approach is to apply a \\ncool roof that meets the minimum \\nrequirements. \\n–\\t Another alternative is to use roof \\nproduc\\nts that do not meet the cool \\nroof criteria and then offset the \\nreduced performance levels by \\nimplementing other measures, such \\nas insulation and window improve\\xad\\nments, that exceed minimum re\\xad\\nquirements. \\n–\\t The third, and most flexible op\\xad\\ntion,\\n is to use whatever methods are \\ndeemed practicable as long as the \\ncode’s specific performance goal is \\nreached. In this scenario, the build\\xad\\ning owner creates a model of all the \\ncharacteristics that affect the energy \\nconsumption of the building to \\ndetermine the mix of measures that \\nwill meet the code criteria. The Cali\\xad\\nfornia Energy Commission provides \\ncomputer software for this compli\\xad\\nance option. \\nCool Roofs in California \\nCalifornia has a long history of sup\\xad\\nporting cool roof research and imple\\xad\\nmentation to alleviate peak energy \\ndemand.  In 2001, the state passed \\nlegislation that activated emergency \\nmeasures, including cool roofs, to \\nreduce peak demand and mitigate \\nthe energy crisis. The cool roofs pro\\xad\\ngram was subsequently formalized \\nas the Cool Savings Program, which \\nprovided rebates to building owners \\nfor installing roofing materials with \\nhigh solar reflectance and thermal \\nemittance. The highest rebate went \\nto roofs on air conditioned buildings, \\nwhile buildings with rooftop ducts \\nand other non-residential buildings \\nwere eligible for a slightly lower \\nrebate. The program was adminis\\xad\\ntered by the California Energy Com\\xad\\nmission but implemented by five \\norganizations directly responsible for \\npromoting the program, recruiting \\ncustomers, verifying project comple\\xad\\ntion, and paying incentives of 15 to \\n25 cents per square foot (0.09 m\\n2) of \\neligible roofing area. The program \\nwas so successful that California re\\xad\\nvised Title 24 to make cool roofs on \\ncertain new or renovated buildings \\nmandatory starting in 2005. \\nCalifornia began the process of updat\\xad\\ni\\nng Title 24 in late 2005, with final revised \\nstandards due in 2008. As part of this \\nupdate, California is investigating extend\\xad\\ning cool roof requirements to houses and \\nbuildings with steep-sloped roofs.

       " '2.8 Air Quality Requirements \\nAs summertime temperatures rise, the rate \\nof ground-level ozone formation, or smog, \\nincreases. By lowering temperatures, urban \\nheat island mitigation strategies can help \\nreduce ground-level ozone concentrations. \\nMany cities and counties are struggling to \\nattain national ambient air quality stan\\xad\\ndards (NAAQS), particularly for ground- \\nlevel ozone. Most of these areas have \\nadopted a wide range of emission con\\xad\\ntrol strategies on traditional air pollution \\nsources and are seeking innovative ways to \\nfurther reduce air pollution levels. Commu\\xad\\nnities are considering urban forestry and \\ncool roofs, in particular, as technologies \\nthat can help them reach attainment. \\nUnder the Clean Air Act, State Implemen\\xad\\ntation Plans (SIPs) are f\\nederally approved \\nand enforceable plans that identify how \\neach state will meet and maintain federal \\nair quality standards. EPA has developed \\nthree policies that help states to include \\nheat island reduction strategies in their \\nSIPs. See the “Policies to Advance Heat \\nIsland Mitigation in SIPs” textbox. \\nA few areas have been working to include \\nheat island reduc\\ntion strategies in their SIPs, \\nincluding Atlanta, Houston, Sacramento, and \\nthe Washington D.C. metropolitan area. In \\n2006, Sacramento secured a large Conges\\xad\\ntion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) \\nImprovement Program grant to work on \\nincluding urban forestry in its SIP. The \\nproject, known as the Urban Forests for Clean \\nAir demonstration project, involves the Sac\\xad\\nramento Tree Foundation, the USDA For\\xad\\nest Service, the Sacramento Area Council of \\nGovernments, and the Sacramento, El Dorado, \\nPlacer, and Feather River Air Districts. The \\nproject includes three phases: 1) initial esti\\xad\\nmates of the effects of the urban forest on air \\nquality; 2) development of improved mod\\xad\\nels to analyze these impacts; and 3) a final \\nreport on the findings. Under the first phase, \\nHeat Island Mitigation \\nStrategies Reduce Ground-\\nLevel Ozone \\nGround-level ozone forms more \\nreadily when air temperatures rise. \\nStrategies to mitigate the urban heat \\nisland reduce air temperatures and \\ntherefore decrease concentrations of \\nground-level ozone. These strate\\xad\\ngies also reduce energy demand for \\ncooling, which reduces air pollution \\nand greenhouse gas emissions associ\\xad\\nated with energy production. When \\nselecting vegetation for a green roof \\nor to plant along a street or other \\nareas, communities in areas with \\npoor air quality may want to consider \\nthe volatile organic compound (VOC) \\nemissions from certain plants, be\\xad\\ncause VOCs are a pre-cursor chemi\\xad\\ncal for ground-level ozone. With the \\nright choice of species, the benefits \\nof additional trees and vegetation far \\noutweigh the costs. \\nthe Forest Service’s Center for Urban Forest \\nR\\nesearch estimated the impacts of trees on \\nair quality using existing models and statisti\\xad\\ncal analyses. That analysis predicted that one \\nmillion additional trees could lower emissions \\nof NO\\nx by almost a quarter ton per day and \\nparticulate matter by over one ton per day. If \\ntrees that emitted low levels of volatile organic \\ncompounds (VOCs) were chosen, ground-level \\nozone could also be reduced by 1.5 tons daily. \\nThe long-term goal for the project is to devel\\xad\\nop the technical support for a SIP revision that \\nincludes large-scale, urban tree planting as a \\nground-level ozone reduction control strat\\xad\\negy for the Sacramento region.

       " 'Policies to Advance Heat Island Mitigation in SIPs \\nCurrently, three EPA policies help states to include heat island reduction strategies in \\ntheir SIPs: \\n1.\\t The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy provides flexibility for states to include \\nin their SIP nontr\\naditional measures, which are measures that do not directly reduce \\nemissions at their source such as a scrubber on a utility smokestack.  Heat island re\\xad\\nduction strategies can be included under this policy. \\n2.\\t The Guidance on State Implementation Plan (SIP) Credits for Emissions Reductions \\nfrom Elec\\ntric-Sector Energy Efficiency or Renewable Energy Measures provides state \\nand local air quality officials with information on how to incorporate energy efficiency \\nand renewable energy measures into their SIPs.  It includes a step-by-step procedure \\nfor estimating emission reductions from these measures, a list of tools and resources \\nfor more information, and examples of proposed SIP submissions. This policy en\\xad\\ncourages cool roofs particularly.  See <http://www.epa.gov/ttncaaa1/t1/memoranda/ \\nereseerem_gd.pdf >. \\n3.\\t The Bundled Measures Policy allows a state to combine many projects and programs \\nthat individually w\\nould not result in large reductions of air pollution emissions.  EPA \\nconsiders the performance of the entire bundle (the sum of the emissions reductions \\nfrom all the measures in the bundle) for SIP evaluation purposes, not the effectiveness \\nof any single measure.  In this way, the responsible agency can include innovative \\nstrategies, such as heat island mitigation measures, that may otherwise be overlooked \\nbecause they do not on an individual basis provide significant air quality benefits. \\nThe Washington D.C. region’s SIP in\\xad\\ncludes a R\\negional Canopy Management \\nPlan as a ground-level ozone reduction \\nstrategy. The plan involves working with \\nlocal governments to establish goals for in\\xad\\ncreasing tree canopy coverage and decreas\\xad\\ning ground-level ozone pollution. In June \\n2007, Fairfax County, Virginia, set a prece\\xad\\ndent by selecting an urban forestry canopy \\ngoal of 45 percent. The county developed \\nthis target after it determined that current \\ntree management efforts would lead to a \\ndecrease in canopy size from 41 percent \\nto 37 percent over the next 30 years. To \\ncombat this loss, the county has proposed \\nincreasing the average number of trees \\nplanted from 21,000 to 84,000, justifying \\nthe expense of additional trees by citing \\nthe multiple benefits they provide. \\nFigure 8: Tree Canopy in Washington D.C. \\nConstruction in and around Washington, D.C., has \\nreduced tree cover (green in this image), but many \\nefforts have formed to slow or reverse this trend. \\nU.S./Japan ASTER Science Team \\nHeat Island ReductIon actIvItIes – dRaFt 19',\n",

       " 'Reduced Air Pollution and Greenhouse \\nGas Emissions. In addition to saving en\\xad\\nergy, the use of trees and vegetation as a \\nmitigation strategy can provide air quality \\nand greenhouse gas benefits: \\n•\\t Leaves remove various pollutants from \\nthe air\\n, referred to as “dry deposition” \\n•\\t Shade trees reduce evaporative emis\\xad\\nsions from park\\ned vehicles \\n•\\t Trees and vegetation remove and \\nstore carbon \\n•\\t Trees and vegetation reduce green\\xad\\nhouse gas emissions from po\\nwer plants \\nby reducing energy demand. \\nResearchers have investigated the potential \\nf\\nor expanding urban tree and vegetative \\ncover to address air quality concerns, such \\nas ground-level ozone. One study pre\\xad\\ndicted that increasing the urban canopy of \\nNew York City by 10 percent could lower \\nground-level ozone by about 3 percent, \\nwhich is significant, particularly in places \\nneeding to decrease emissions to meet air \\nquality standards for this pollutant.\\n18 \\nPollutant Removal through Dry Depo\\xad\\nsition. Plants generally take up gaseous \\npollutants, primarily through leaf stomata, \\nthat then react with water inside the \\nplant to form acids and other chemicals. \\nPlants can also intercept particulate mat\\xad\\nter as wind currents blow particulates into \\ncontact with the plants’ surfaces. Some \\nparticulates are absorbed into the plant \\nwhile others adhere to the surface, where \\nthey can be resuspended into the atmo\\xad\\nsphere by winds or washed off by rain to \\nthe soil beneath.\\n19 These processes can \\nreduce various pollutants found in the \\nurban environment, including particulate \\nmatter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO\\nX), sulfur \\ndioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and \\nground-level ozone (O 3). \\nVarious studies have documented how \\nurban trees can reduce pollutants. \\nA 2006 \\nstudy estimated total annual air pollutant \\nremoval by urban trees in the United States \\nat 784,000 tons, with a value of $3.8 bil\\xad\\nlion.\\n20 The study focused only on deposi\\xad\\ntion of ground-level ozone, PM less than 10 \\nmicrons in diameter (PM\\n10), nitrogen diox\\xad\\nide (NO2), SO2, and CO. Although the esti\\xad\\nmated changes in local ambient air quality \\nwere modest, typically less than 1 percent, \\nthe study noted that additional benefits \\nwould be gained if urban temperature and \\nenergy impacts from trees and vegetation \\nwere also included. \\nReduced Evaporative Emissions. T\\n ree \\nshade can keep parked cars—particularly \\ntheir gas tanks—cooler, which lowers \\nevaporative emissions of volatile organic \\ncompounds (VOCs), a critical precursor \\npollutant in the formation of ground-level \\nozone. Most large urban areas have a wide \\nrange of control programs to reduce these \\nemissions, and tree shading programs can \\nbe part of those strategies. For example, \\none analysis predicted that light-duty \\nvehicle evaporative VOC emission rates \\nthroughout Sacramento County could be \\nreduced by 2 percent per day if the com\\xad\\nmunity increased the tree canopy over \\nparking lots from 8 to 50 percent.\\n21 \\nCarbon Storage and Sequestration. As \\ntrees grow, they remove carbon from the \\natmosphere and store, or sequester, it. As \\ntrees die or deposit litter and debris on the \\nground, carbon is released to the atmo\\xad\\nsphere or transferred to the soil. The net \\neffect of this carbon cycle is a substantial \\nlevel of carbon storage in trees, vegetation, \\nand soils. \\nThe net rate of carbon sequestered by \\nurban trees in the continental United States \\nin 2005 is estimated to ha\\nve been around \\n24 million tons per year (88.5 million tons \\nRedUcING URBAN HeAt IslANds – dRAFt 6',\n",

To the extent that \\nreduced energy consumption decreases fos\\xad\\nsil fuel burning in power plants, trees and \\nvegetation also contribute to lower carbon \\nemissions from those power plants. One \\nmodeling study estimated that the direct \\nenergy savings from shading alone by trees \\nand vegetation could reduce carbon emis\\xad\\nsions in various U.S. metropolitan areas \\nby roughly 1.5 to 5 percent.\\n25 The study \\nassumed that eight shade trees would be \\nplaced strategically around residential and \\nof\\nfice buildings and four around retail \\nstores. As urban forests also contribute to \\nair temperature reductions, the study found \\nthat there would be additional reductions \\nin energy use and carbon emissions from \\nthose indirect effects as well. \\nFull Life-cycle Carbon Reductions. In or\\xad\\nder to inv\\nestigate the full life-cycle impact \\nof urban trees on annual CO2 emissions, \\nresearchers consider: \\n•\\t Annual CO2 carbon sequestration rates \\n•\\t Annual CO2 releases from decomposition \\n•\\t Annual CO2 releases from maintenance \\nactivities \\n•\\t Annual CO2 avoided emissions because \\nof reduced energy use. \\nBy combining these four variables, re\\xad\\nsearchers can estimate the net CO2 reduc\\xad\\ntions from urban forest resources for a \\nspecific community and calculate the asso\\xad\\nciated net monetary benefits. A 2006 field \\nstudy found that about 15,000 inventoried \\nstreet trees in Charleston, South Carolina, \\nwere responsible for an annual net re\\xad\\nduction of over 1,500 tons of CO\\n2.

Using green \\nroofs throughout a city can help reduce \\nsurface urban heat islands and cool the air. \\nShading. The plants of a green roof and \\nthe associated growing medium,\\n a specially \\nengineered soil, block sunlight from reach\\xad\\ning the underlying roof membrane. Though \\ntrees and vines may not be common on \\ngreen roofs, they indicate how other vege\\xad\\ntation on green roofs shade surfaces below \\nthem. For example, the amount of sunlight \\ntransmitted through the canopy of a tree \\nwill vary by species. In the summertime, \\ngenerally only 10 to 30 percent of the sun’s \\nenergy reaches the area below a tree, with \\nGreen Roof Market \\nIn the United States demand and \\ninterest in green roofs has grown \\ntremendously. A survey of Green \\nRoofs for Healthy Cities members \\nfound that 25 percent more square \\nfeet of green roofing were installed \\nin the United States in 2005 than in \\n2004.\\n3 A Green Roofs Project Data\\xad\\nbase, available at <www.greenroofs. \\ncom/projects/plist.php>, estimated \\na total of 6.6 million square feet \\n(614,000 m\\n2) of completed or ongo\\xad\\ning green roof projects in the United \\nStates as of June 2007.  Germany, \\nwidely considered a leader in green \\nroof research, technology, and usage, \\nhas had decades of experience with \\ngreen roofs.

These cooler surfaces, \\nin turn, reduce the heat transmitted into \\nbuildings or re-emitted into the atmo\\xad\\nsphere.

Together, the \\nprocesses of evaporation and transpiration \\nare referred to as evapotranspiration.

Numerous communities and \\nresearch centers have compared surface \\ntemperatures between green and conven\\xad\\ntional roofs. For example: \\n•\\t Chicago compared summertime surface \\ntemperatures on a green roof with a \\nneighboring building.\\n On an August \\nday in the early afternoon, with tem\\xad\\nperatures in the 90s, the green roof \\nsurface temperature ranged from 91 to \\n119°F (33 to 48°C), while the dark,\\n con\\xad\\nventional roof of the adjacent building \\nwas 169°F (76°C). The near-surface air \\ntemperature above the green roof was \\nabout 7°F (4°C) cooler than that over \\nthe conventional roof.\\n9 \\n•\\t A similar study in Florida found that \\nthe av\\nerage maximum surface tempera\\xad\\nture of a green roof was 86°F (30°C) \\nwhile the adjacent light-colored roof \\nwas 134°F (57°C).\\n10 \\nReduced surface temperatures help build\\xad\\nings stay cooler because less heat flows \\nthrough the roof and into the building. In \\naddition, lower green roof temperatures \\nresult in less heat transfer to the air above \\nthe roof, which can help keep urban air \\ntemperatures lower as well. Some analyses \\nhave attempted to quantify the potential \\ntemperature reductions over a broad area \\nfrom widespread adoption of green roof \\ntechnology. A modeling study for Toronto, \\nCanada, for example, predicted that adding \\ngreen roofs to 50 percent of the available \\nsurfaces downtown would cool the entire \\ncity by 0.2 to 1.4°F (0.1 to 0.8°C). Irrigating \\nthese roofs could further reduce tempera\\xad\\ntures by about 3.5°F (2°C) and extend a 1 \\nto 2°F (0.5-1°C) cooled area over a larger \\ngeographic region.

Green Roof Types \\nA green roof can be as simple as a 2-inch \\n(5 cm) covering of hardy, alpine-like \\ngroundcover, generally termed an “exten\\xad\\nsive” system, or as complex as a fully ac\\xad\\ncessible park complete with trees, called an \\n“intensive” system. \\n2.1 Extensive Green Roofs \\nFor the simpler, lighter weight extensive \\ngreen roof system, plant selections typi\\xad\\ncally include sedums—succulent, hardy \\nplants—and other vegetation generally suit\\xad\\nable for an alpine environment. The con\\xad\\ncept is to design a rugged green roof that \\nneeds little maintenance or human interven\\xad\\ntion once it is established. Plants adapted to \\nextreme climates often make good choices \\nand may not require permanent irrigation \\nsystems. Overall, because of their light \\nweight, extensive systems will require the \\nleast amount of added structural support, \\nwhich improv\\nes their cost-effectiveness \\nwhen retrofitting an existing structure. \\nExtensive green roofs have been grown on \\nroofs with slopes of 30° or more, which \\nw\\nould equal a ratio of rise to run of 7:12 or \\ngreater. (In contrast, a low-sloped roof with \\na ratio of rise to run of 2:12 would have a \\nslope of 9.5°.) The slope determines if the \\nroof will need additional support to hold \\nthe growing medium and other parts of the \\nvegetative layer in place. Steeper roofs may \\nretain less stormwater than an equivalent, \\nflatter roof. \\n2.2 Intensive Green Roofs \\nAn intensive green roof is like a conven\\xad\\ntional garden, or park, with almost no limit \\non the type of available plants, including \\nlarge trees and shrubs. Building owners or \\nmanagers often install these roofs to save \\nenergy and provide a garden environment \\nfor the building occupants or the general \\npublic to enjoy. Compared to extensive \\ngreen roofs, intensive green roofs are \\nheavier and require a higher initial invest\\xad\\nment and more maintenance over the long \\nterm than extensive roofs. They generally \\nrequire more structural support to ac\\xad\\ncommodate the weight of the additional \\ngrowing medium and public use. Intensive \\nREDUCING URBAN HEAT ISLANDS – DRAFT 4',\n",

Green roofs can \\nsave energy needed to cool and heat \\nthe buildings they shelter. When green \\nroofs are wet, they absorb and store large \\namounts of heat, which reduces tempera\\xad\\nture fluctuations. When dry, green roof lay\\xad\\ners act as an insulator, decreasing the flow \\nof heat through the roof, thereby reducing \\nthe cooling energy needed to reduce build\\xad\\ning interior temperatures. In the winter, \\nthis insulating effect means that less heat \\nfrom inside the building is lost through the \\nroof, which reduces heating needs. In the \\nsummertime, green roof vegetation reduces \\nroof surface temperatures and ambient air \\ntemperatures, thus lowering cooling energy \\ndemand. The insulating properties of green \\nroofs vary as they are dynamic systems that \\nchange throughout the year, particularly \\nwith regard to water storage. As with cool \\nroofs, discussed in the “Cool Roof” chapter, \\ngreen roofs should not be used as a substi\\xad\\ntute for insulation. \\nGREEN ROOFS – DRAFT 5',\n",

Similarly, \\n“high profile” or “deep profile” has \\nbeen used instead of “intensive” to \\ndescribe a heavier, more complex \\ngreen roof system with deeper soil. \\nFigure 8 compares the average daily flow \\nof heat through a dark, conv\\nentional roof \\nand an extensive green roof in Ottawa, \\nCanada. During the spring and summer, \\nfrom May to September 2001, the energy \\ndemand needed to remove heat that flowed \\nthrough the conventional roof was six to \\neight kilowatt hours (kWh) a day, while the \\ngreen roof’s energy demand from heat flow \\nwas less than 1.5 kWh a day, a reduction of \\nmore than 75 percent. In contrast, during \\nthe fall and winter months, from Novem\\xad\\nber 2000 through March 2001, heat flow \\nthrough the green roof was only slightly \\nless than the reference roof in all months \\nex\\ncept January, so that the energy demand \\nfrom both roofs was relatively similar. \\nDuring this time, snow had accumulated, \\nand the temperatures of both roofs stayed \\nabout the same.\\n16 \\nAlthough green roofs can save energy both \\nin summer and winter, the specific savings \\nwill depend on the local climate and individ\\xad\\nual building and roof characteristics, such as \\nsize, use, and insulation.

The initial cost of a green roof, on the other \\nhand, is much higher, starting from $10 per square \\nfoot for the basic, extensive green roof. \\nBoth cool and green roofs lower surface and air temperatures and reduce summer\\xad\\ntime peak and ov\\nerall energy demand.

It is also nec\\xad\\nessary to keep drains and gutters clear \\nof plant growth to prevent blockage. \\nIn addition to routine maintenance, green \\nroofs may require repairs o\\nver time, al\\xad\\nthough the expected life of a green roof is \\nabout twice that of a conventional roof.\\n56 \\nIf correctly installed, the membrane under \\nthe vegetation of a green roof is expected \\nto last 30 to 50 years. \\n4.3 \\tFire Safety \\nGreen roofs, when saturated with water, \\ncan retard the spread of fire,\\n57 but dry \\nplants on a green roof can be a fire hazard. \\nThe most common ways to increase fire \\nsafety are to: \\n•\\t Avoid grasses and plants that could \\ndry up in summer and instead use fire \\nresistant plants,\\n like sedums, and a \\ngrowing medium that is low in organic \\nmaterial content. \\n•\\t Construct fire breaks on the roof— \\n2-foot (0.6 m) widths of concrete or \\ngr\\navel at 130-foot (40 m) intervals. \\nAnother precaution that some practitioners \\nrecommend is to install sprinkler irrigation \\nsystems and connec\\nt them to a fire alarm. \\n5 .\\t  Green Roof Initiatives \\nGreen roof research efforts are growing with \\nan increasing number of universities offer\\xad\\ning courses or developing centers focused \\non improving our understanding of green \\nroof technology. Many communities are also \\ntaking action by encouraging or sponsor\\xad\\ning green roof projects. These initiatives are \\ntypically motivated by various environmental \\nconcerns, mainly stormwater management, \\nbut also the desire to reduce urban heat \\nislands and enhance the urban ecosystem. \\nMany of these efforts involve a single dem\\xad\\nonstration or showcase project as a highly \\nvisible means to promote green roof technol\\xad\\nogy, such as the green roof on Atlanta’s City \\nREDUCING URBAN HEAT ISLANDS – DRAFT 18',\n",

Some cities such as Chicago, Port\\xad\\nland, Seattle, and Toronto have been develop\\xad\\ning more coordinated programs and policies \\nto promote green roofs. The “Heat Island \\nReduction Activities” chapter provides many \\nexamples demonstrating the wide range of \\ngreen roof efforts.

       " 'URBAN HeA t IslANd BAsIcs – dRAFt 1\\nA\\ns urban areas develop, changes occur in the landscape. Buildings, roads, and other \\ninfrastructure replace open land and vegetation. Surfaces that were once perme-\\nable and moist generally become impermeable and dry.* This development leads to \\nthe formation of urban heat islands—the phenomenon whereby urban regions experience \\nwarmer temperatures than their rural surroundings. \\nThis chapter provides an overview of different types of urban heat islands, methods for \\nidentifying them, and factors that contribute to their development. It introduces key con-\\ncepts that are important to understanding and mitigating this phenomenon, as well as ad-\\nditional sources of information. It discusses:\\nGeneral features of urban heat islands •\\t\\nSurface versus atmospheric heat islands•\\t\\nCauses of urban heat island formation•\\t\\nUrban heat island impacts on energy consumption, environmental quality, and human health•\\t\\nResources for further information.•\\t\\n1 .  What Are Urban Heat Islands?\\nMany urban and suburban areas experience elevated temperatures compared to their out-\\nlying rural surroundings; this difference in temperature is what constitutes an urban heat \\nisland. The annual mean air temperature of a city with one million or more people can \\nbe 1.8 to 5.4°F (1 to 3°C) warmer than its surroundings,1 and on a clear, calm night, this \\ntemperature difference can be as much as 22°F (12°C).2 Even smaller cities and towns will \\nproduce heat islands, though the effect often decreases as city size decreases.3 \\nThis chapter focuses on surface and atmospheric urban heat islands. These two heat island \\ntypes differ in the ways they are formed, the techniques used to identify and measure \\nthem, their impacts, and to some degree, the methods available to mitigate them.

This absorbed heat increases \\nsurface temperatures and contributes to \\nthe formation of surface and atmospheric \\nurban heat islands. \\nAlthough solar reflectance is the main \\ndeterminant of a material’s surface tem-\\nperature, thermal emittance, or emissivity, \\nalso plays a role. Thermal emittance is a \\nmeasure of a surface’s ability to shed heat, \\nor emit long-wave (infrared) radiation.

Urban geometry influences \\nwind flow, energy absorption, and a given \\nsurface’s ability to emit long-wave radiation \\nback to space. In developed areas, surfaces \\nand structures are often at least partially \\nobstructed by objects, such as neighbor-\\ning buildings, and become large thermal \\nmasses that cannot release their heat very \\nreadily because of these obstructions.

During \\nthe day, urban canyons can have compet-\\ning effects. On the one hand, tall buildings \\ncan create shade, reducing surface and air \\ntemperatures. On the other, when sunlight \\nreaches surfaces in the canyon, the sun’s \\nenergy is reflected and absorbed by build-\\ning walls, which further lowers the city’s \\noverall albedo—the net reflectance from \\nsurface albedo plus urban geometry—\\nand can increase temperatures.11 At night, \\nurban canyons generally impede cooling, \\nas buildings and structures can obstruct \\nthe heat that is being released from urban \\ninfrastructure. \\nTable 2: Factors that Create Urban Heat Islands\\nFactors Communities are Focusing On\\nReduced vegetation in urban regions:  Reduces the natural cooling effect from shade and evapotranspiration. •\\t\\nProperties of urban materials:  Contribute to absorption of solar energy, causing surfaces, and the air above •\\t\\nthem, to be warmer in urban areas than those in rural surroundings.\\nFuture Factors to Consider\\nUrban geometry:  The height and spacing of buildings affects the amount of radiation received and emitted by •\\t\\nurban infrastructure.\\nAnthropogenic heat emissions:  Contribute additional warmth to the air.*•\\t\\nAdditional Factors\\nWeather:  Certain conditions, such as clear skies and calm winds, can foster urban heat island formation.•\\t\\nGeographic location:  Proximity to large water bodies and mountainous terrain can influence local wind patterns •\\t\\nand urban heat island formation.\\n*  Although communities currently can lower anthropogenic heat emissions through energy efficiency technologies \\nin the building and vehicle sectors, this compendium focuses on modifying vegetative cover and surface properties \\nof urban materials, as they have long been regarded as urban heat island reduction strategies.

This peak urban electric demand \\nincreases 1.5 to 2 percent for every 1°F \\n(0.6°C) increase in summertime tempera-\\nture.

The Centers for \\nDisease Control estimates that from 1979 to \\n1999, excessive heat exposure contributed \\nto more than 8,000 premature deaths in \\nthe United States.18 This figure exceeds the \\nnumber of mortalities resulting from hur-\\nricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and \\nearthquakes combined. \\n3.4  Water Quality\\nSurface urban heat islands degrade water \\nquality, mainly by thermal pollution. Pave -\\nment and rooftop surfaces that reach tem -\\nperatures 50 to 90°F (27 to 50°C) higher \\nthan air temperatures transfer this excess \\nheat to stormwater. Field measurements \\nfrom one study showed that runoff from \\nurban areas was about 20-30°F (11-17°C) \\nhotter than runoff from a nearby rural \\narea on summer days when pavement \\ntemperatures at midday were 20-35°F \\n(11-19°C) above air temperature. When \\nthe rain came before the pavement had \\na chance to heat up, runoff temperatures \\nfrom the rural and urban areas differed by \\nless than 4°F (2°C). 19  This heated storm-\\nwater generally drains into storm sewers \\n(see Figure 5) and raises water tempera -\\ntures as it is released into streams, rivers, \\nponds, and lakes. A study in Arlington, \\nVirginia, recorded temperature increases \\nin surface waters as high as 8ºF (4°C) in \\n40 minutes after heavy summer rains. 20 \\nWater temperature affects all aspects of \\naquatic life, especially the metabolism \\nand reproduction of many aquatic spe-\\ncies.

Living on the upper floor of a typical row home, with a dark \\nroof, brick construction, and windows on only two sides, could contribute to the risk \\nof heat-related illness or death during heat waves, as temperatures in these homes \\ncan be extreme.16 These homes often lack air conditioning, especially in areas un-\\naccustomed to high temperatures. Further, even when air conditioning is available, \\nresidents may not use it for fear of high utility bills.   \\nSocial isolation and physical health also contribute to one’s vulnerability. Elderly \\npeople, especially, may not have family or friends nearby, may not report to work \\nregularly, and may lack neighbors who can check on them, leaving them stranded \\nduring extreme heat events. The elderly may also fail to hear news or other warnings \\nof impending heat waves and recommendations on how to cope.  Finally, their bod-\\nies may be less able to handle heat stress. \\nThe lack of nighttime relief in air temperatures is strongly correlated with increased \\nmortality during heat waves. Some studies suggest that these oppressive nighttime \\ntemperatures may be more significant than high maximum daytime temperatures.17\\nFor more information on heat-related health incidents and ways to respond, see the EPA \\nExcessive Heat Events Guidebook <www.epa.gov/hiri/about/pdf/EHEguide_final.pdf>',\n",

Materials such as reﬂective street pavements, coating materials\\nincluding light-colored paint, phase-change materials, color-changing paint, ﬂuorescence paint, and\\nenergy-efﬁcient appliances are considered sustainable materials, whereas green infrastructure like\\ngreen roofs, green walls, green parking and pavements, and shaded streets are considered to mitigate\\nthe urban heat island effect.

Introduction\\nRapid advancement in the built environment and increasing urbanization are alter-\\ning ecosystems and climates, with surface temperature being one of the most inﬂuential\\nfactors [1], and increased energy consumption in the urban environment contributes di-\\nrectly to the rise in surface temperature [2]. Due to urbanization and human activities, the\\nurban heat island (UHI) effect, which is caused by an increase in surface temperature, is\\none of the most severe problems in urban areas [3]. The impact of UHI can be measured by\\nusing the heat and humidity index (THI), the related stress index (RSI), and the number of\\nBeer Garden days [4]. The UHI effect has a negative inﬂuence not only on the environment\\nbut also on the health of the inhabitants. Multiple studies indicate that indigestion is a\\ncommon problem, as well as nervous system disorders such as memory loss, depression,\\nirritability, and sleeplessness [5].\\nIn addition to that, the UHI’s thermal impact may cause a signiﬁcant circulation of\\npollution, resulting in local winds that migrate from suburban to urban areas, bringing city-\\ncontaminated air that is now present in rural areas back to urban areas, worsening urban\\nair pollution and also increasing the ﬁnancial burden on city dwellers. The solar radiation\\nSustainability 2023, 15, 10767. https://doi.org/10.3390/su151410767 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability',\n",

The arrangement of buildings has a\\nsigniﬁcant impact on the distribution of shadows and temperature differences throughout\\na city. The canyon-like shape of streetscapes surrounded by high-rise buildings has an\\neffect on wind patterns in urban canyons due to the intricate heat exchange between the\\nmass of the buildings and the surrounding atmosphere [7]. Urban heat exchange is affected\\nby a number of factors, including the thermal characteristics of urban surface materials,\\ncolor, texture, and coverage [8].\\nThe lack of vegetation in urban areas increases the amount of heat absorbed by different\\ncomponents such as buildings, pavement, and roads. Human activities such as driving and\\nHVAC (heat, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems are also major contributors to heat\\naccumulation in the atmosphere. Basically, the UHI effect is measured on three different\\nlevels: the ground level, the canopy level, and the urban level [9]. Speciﬁcally, the thermal\\nbehavior of surface materials and their exposure to solar radiation impact the UHI effect.\\nThe atmosphere over urban areas can be affected by the emission of heat and subsequent\\nconvectional mixing of the heat [10]. The amount of heat accumulated in the canopy layer\\nis affected by a number of factors, including the geometry and orientation of open spaces,\\nthe aspect ratio, the sky view factor, the land cover materials, and the direction and velocity\\nof the wind [11,12].\\nThe urban surface layer’s emitted heat is blended together by turbulence in the air\\nabove the canopy layer of the urban areas [13]. Above the canopy layer, local air is mixed,\\nleading to the formation of a warm air dome over inhabited areas [14]. Due to the convective\\nnature of the atmosphere, the urban boundary layer tends to be at its thickest at midnight.\\nDue to its high heat resistance, the air has a relatively thin surface layer that only goes down\\na few centimeters [15]. By late afternoon, when the urban canopy has been heating in the\\nsun for several hours, the air temperature in the canopy layer has reached its maximum [16].\\nAlthough the urban boundary layer is at its thickest in the evening, when warm air is pulled\\ninto the lower atmosphere, it forms a dome of warm air above the urban zone. The rural\\nboundary layer ﬂuctuates throughout the day, reaching its highest point at the same time\\nas the day’s highest surface temperature [17].\\nResponses to the effect of UHIs can be categorized as either adaptation or mitigation.\\nAdaptations are made to decrease the harm, whereas mitigation is an activity performed to\\nlessen the intensity or amount of the effect. The UHI effect can be adapted to and mitigated\\nat the building, neighborhood, municipal, and regional levels. This study is an attempt to\\nﬁll a need in the existing literature by offering a synoptic perspective of sustainable green\\ninfrastructure and materials that may be used in urban areas to reduce the UHI impact.\\nTable 1 presents the background of the strategies reviewed in this study for the mitigation\\nof UHIs. According to prior research by Shishegar 2014, increasing urban green spaces\\nlike parks, street trees, and green roofs may help reduce the UHI impact [ 18]. Petzold\\nand Mose 2023 also undertook a study that investigated the economic and social factors\\naround urban greening infrastructure [19]. Hence, the results from this study and ensuing\\nsuggestions aim to beneﬁt the built environment in its pursuit of UHI mitigation strategies.\\nConsequently, presented herein is the speciﬁc scope of the study:\\n• Identifying suitable green infrastructure that can be incorporated within the built-up\\nareas in the urban setting.\\n• The identiﬁcation of sustainable materials that can be integrated with building compo-\\nnents to reduce the UHI effect.\\n• Examining the principle behind those identiﬁed techniques and their effectiveness in\\nimplementation.\\n• Identifying the most prevalent obstacles to the widespread implementation of the\\nidentified UHI mitigation strategies in urban areas and proposing solutions to\\nthese problems.\\nThe next section describes the methodology implemented in this review.

Materials and Methods\\nThe issue of UHIs and sustainable mitigation practices is gaining relevance among\\nindividuals residing in densely populated urban areas. Global industrial and development\\nactivities have led to an increased emphasis on environmental sustainability, which marks\\na departure from past practices. Given the escalating expenses associated with the UHI\\nphenomenon, it is imperative to prioritize the identiﬁcation of sustainable measures aimed\\nat mitigating its adverse impacts. Despite the fact that a number of studies have already\\nbeen conducted to identify sustainable green strategies, this study will concentrate on\\na variety of urban-speciﬁc strategies that incorporate the built environment. This study\\nreviewed over 315 documents to gather the recent literature; however, 163 were irrelevant to\\nthe study’s objectives and out-of-date. Consequently, they were excluded.

Incorporation of Green Infrastructure into Buildings\\nGreen infrastructure is the addition of blue (water) and green (vegetation) components\\nin contrast to the constructed environment to improve and manage environmental systems\\nto enhance the quality of life in the ecosystem [ 20]. These green assets, if well-planned\\nand designed, could mitigate the negative impacts of urban heat islands (UHIs) and\\nclimate change while also improving residents’ quality of life. Green infrastructure is\\nthe strategic approach to developing and optimizing sustainable management systems\\nof urban natural ecosystems in the face of climate change challenges. Innovative and\\nwell-developed potential practices can be considered by urban planners inside the built\\nenvironment, including the implementation of green strategies into the main components,\\nsuch as rooftops, façades, parking areas for buildings, pavements, walls, and landscaping\\nareas to reduce the UHI effect with sustainable green and blue concepts.\\nGiven the limited land resources, signiﬁcantly increasing the density of green space is\\na challenging task. As a result, enhancing the spatial arrangement of green space could be\\na viable option. The signiﬁcance of green space in mitigating urban heat islands (UHIs) is\\nattributed to its spatial characteristics, including size, composition, and conﬁguration [21].\\nAs such, it is important that the unique qualities and characteristics be taken into account\\nthroughout planning, construction, and maintenance [ 22]. The environmental sector is\\nput to the test by green infrastructure, which calls for a holistic and environmentally\\nfriendly strategy that integrates more concerns. Pressures may also be felt regarding the\\ngrowing concerns of energy demand, consumption, and production, all of which have\\ndirect and indirect effects on the environmental facet of developing building infrastructure.\\nHeat gain and loss are major factors on roofs since they represent the greatest exposed\\nspace. Traditional rooﬁng practices using a variety of materials have contributed to the\\nexcessive heat buildup within structures and in the immediate vicinity [ 23]. As a result,\\nmany regions of the globe are becoming familiar with the practice of initiating green\\nrooﬁng approaches by using greenery techniques and regulating the excessive heat and\\nheat variations surrounding the plants.',\n",

Despite the vertical openness to the surroundings, the UHI\\neffect is signiﬁcantly impacted by façades due to the solar heat absorption potential and\\nheat release from nearby buildings [24]. The streets and paving systems around a structure\\nare essential in making it accessible to the public. The UHI impact is inﬂuenced by the\\nlayout of streets and pavement, including whether they are exposed to or sheltered from\\nthe sun, as well as by nearby buildings and other factors. The right planning of roadways\\nand pavements, as well as the inclusion of sustainable ﬂora, is crucial. As a result, the\\nintroduction of novel green infrastructure techniques into high-rise buildings and a full\\ninvestigation of the seriousness of all these components via past literature studies are\\nrequired for the present situation. Each facet of green infrastructure is examined in depth\\nin this section.\\n3.1. Green Rooﬁng Techniques\\nA green rooﬁng system is one of the useful tools for reducing the UHI effect by cooling\\nthe surrounding atmosphere. The built environment is being built at the expense of parks\\nand other green spaces as a result of rapid urbanization [ 25]. This leads to a scarcity of\\nvegetation, which reduces canopy interception and transpiration within the city, raising\\ntemperatures and lowering humidity [26]. Changing the characteristics of rooftops can help\\nalleviate some of these issues. The addition of vegetation and soil to unused rooftop spaces\\nis typically seen as a good method for making buildings more environmentally friendly [27].\\nHence, green roofs are just rooftops that have had vegetation transplanted onto a growing\\nmedium. Beneﬁts to the buildings’ aesthetics, the environment, and the economy can be\\ngained by encouraging the development of green roofs. Vegetation, substrate, ﬁlter fabric,\\ndrainage material, a root barrier, and insulation are the components that comprise a green\\nroof [28]. Figure 2 shows the typical layers of a green roof system.\\nSubstituting man-made, impermeable surfaces in built environment areas is the pri-\\nmary driver of UHIs [ 29]. Vegetation holds water in order for it to be evaporated back\\ninto the air through evapotranspiration, which not only cools the vegetated surface and\\nlow-level atmosphere but also lowers the amount of energy held in urban materials and\\nreleased as heat [30]. Latent heat results from the transformation of evapotranspiration\\nenergy into the cooling of water vapor molecules in the higher atmosphere [31]. Rainwater\\nevaporation converts some of the solar energy into latent heat, but hard, non-porous sur-\\nfaces still collect most of the solar radiation and radiate them as heat. Roofs that are too\\nwarm boost the UHI but also allow more heat into a building, leading to higher indoor\\ntemperatures [10].\\nRising temperatures also raise the peak loads required to meet the requirements for air\\nconditioning and refrigeration, which can result in increased emissions of greenhouse gases\\n(GHGs), and other pollutants [32]. Green roofs may provide additional beneﬁts to building\\noccupants and city dwellers, including reduced heating and cooling costs and increased\\ndurability of roof membranes due to temperature ﬂuctuations [33]. Reduced stormwater\\nrunoff and combined sewage overﬂow, which occurs when the sewer system is ﬂushed\\nduring extreme rainfall events, are also added beneﬁts of green rooﬁng. Green roofs can\\nbe either intensive or extensive. Intensive green roofs have a thick substrate layer, a large\\ndiversity of plants, high upkeep, high capital cost, and a higher weight; therefore, they\\nusually require a lot of maintenance in the form of fertilizing, weeding, and watering [34].\\nHowever, extensive green roofs have a thin substrate layer, low capital cost, low weight,\\nand minimal upkeep. Extensive green roof systems are often employed when no further\\nstructural support is required [34].\\nPart of the water that falls on a green roof is absorbed by the developing substrate or is\\nheld in pore spaces. Vegetation can take water in and either store it in their tissues or release\\nit back into the air through a process called transpiration. The remaining water is sent into\\nthe drainage system after passing through the ﬁlter cloth. Water will be held back since it\\ncan be stored in the granules’ pores or the drainage modules’ compartments. One of the',\n",

Energy savings from green roofs are an enticing\\nprospect in the construction industry. By increasing the efﬁciency of a building’s insulation,\\nthey help cut down on the amount of energy needed to heat and cool them [36]. A green\\nroof can lower indoor temperatures which depend on the roof’s green area. Increases in\\nshading, improved insulation, and a larger thermal mass of the roof system are mostly\\nresponsible for the noticeable rise in thermal performance.\\nSustainability 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 27 \\n \\n \\nand watering [34].

The typical layers of a green roof system [37]. \\n3.2. Green Wall Techniques \\nOne alternative to using traditional wall cons truction to reduce the UHI effect is to \\nuse green walls, which are covered in plants. When compared to low-rise buildings, high-\\nrises have a greater expanse of wall surface area and thus a greater potential for greenery \\nimplementations, increasing the effectiveness of such practices. The execution makes use \\nof vertical walls that are either completely or partially covered in plants, resulting in an \\nextravagantly verdant aesthetic [38]. Despite centering on UHI mitigation techniques, it \\nprovides a pleasant perspective and contribu tes to a livelier environment. Green walls \\nimprove air quality and aesthetics by removing carbon dioxide (CO\\n2), which is a GHG, \\nfrom the air, therefore reducing temperatures inside and out [39].  \\nLiving walls and green façades are the two main types of green walls. A living wall \\nconsists of panels attached to an internal or external vertical structure (Figure 3), whereas \\na green façade is a system in which a natural climber plant is grown on the exterior of a \\nbuilding with the help of an auxiliary framework (Figure 4) [40]. The panels are ideal for \\ngrowing upholstery plants. A green façade is a wall that has been grown over by plants \\nthat either climb or cascade over the wall.

Green Parking, Pavements and Shaded Streets\\nOne such method of reducing UHIs is through increasing tree cover and creating\\nshade. Trees’ leaf density, leaf area, and evapotranspiration all have a role, as do their\\ngeometric qualities. Urban temperatures and land surface elevations may be stabilized to\\nsome degree by the careful planning and design of urban landscaping and green areas [47].\\nDuring the summer, the amount of solar energy absorbed is decreased as the percent-\\nage of vegetative cover increases, especially if the canopy index is high [ 48]. Trees in\\nurban regions face a number of challenges due to impervious cover, poor soil moisture,\\nnutritional scarcity, a lack of rooting volume, water/air pollution, and transport-related\\ntoxicity [49]. The longevity of tree populations in cities is further affected by factors such\\nas low-temperature pressures, anthropogenic heat sources, air turbulence, and high wind',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 11 of 26\\nspeed owing to urban canyons [50]. Tree species vary in their evapotranspiration rates, heat,\\nand drought tolerance based on a number of factors including morphology, physiology,\\nlocal water supply, and wind velocity. Although pavement surface temperatures are raised\\nby direct solar radiation, they are lowered by tree canopies. As the amount of asphalt,\\nconcrete, and other impermeable surfaces grows, the overnight temperatures rise [ 51].\\nImprovements in nighttime urban warming mitigation may be achieved by the elimination\\nof non-permeable surfaces.\\nIncreasing the ratio of impervious surfaces to canopy cover is an important mitigating\\ntechnique. Solar radiation through the canopy helps keep the ground below at a constant\\ntemperature. Pavement undergoes a freezing and thawing cycle as a result of nighttime\\nheat loss and temperature drops. Cracks in the pavement form as a result of the pavement’s\\nexposure to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing [52]. As the rate of pavement degrada-\\ntion rises, the pavement’s useful life decreases. Trees may reduce daytime temperatures,\\nwhich in turn reduces the temperature gradients between the road and the surrounding\\nlandscape. The pavement’s durability is increased as a result of this [53]. The UHI may be\\nmitigated by urban shade because it lowers local temperatures and slows down the rate at\\nwhich heat is conducted away from surfaces. The geometry, structure, leaf size, and canopy\\ncover density of trees are all quantiﬁable factors in urban shade.\\nCreating tree-shaded areas improves occupants’ thermal comfort inside the built\\nenvironment in hot climates [5]. Trees with a wide canopy may block solar radiation and\\nthe rays reﬂected off concrete, asphalt, glass, and other man-made surfaces. The quality\\nof shade may be enhanced by increasing canopy leaf area, size, density, projection, and\\ntransmissivity [54]. Shade may cut down on heat intake from buildings and other structures,\\nas well as on heat exchange and surface temperatures. Leaf structure, epidermal features,\\nand angle all have a role in reﬂectance. A foliar canopy affects absorption, and it is most\\noften assessed by calculating the leaf-area index, chlorophyll content, and water content of\\nthe plant [55]. The quantity of solar radiation that penetrates a canopy may be measured\\nusing a dimensionless ratio such as transmissivity, which is affected by the structure of\\nthe canopy [56].\\nA variety of mechanisms, including reﬂection, absorption, and transmission, allow\\ntrees and other plants to diffuse solar radiation. Part of the solar energy that is taken in\\nis used for photosynthesis, while the rest is transformed into heat [ 57]. This is because\\nthe leaves warm up as they absorb more heat. Water from the leaf is turned into water\\nvapor and exhaled into the atmosphere via the stomata. Water vapor is converted during\\nthe conversion process, which results in the leaf cooling as a result of the loss of latent\\nheat [58]. Plants are able to chill the air around them by taking in carbon dioxide during\\nphotosynthesis and exhaling it during transpiration. When combined with shade, this\\ntechnique causes an overall cooling of the environment throughout the summer [59].\\nThe peak air temperature is higher in open terrain than in vegetative areas. Suburbs\\ndevoid of mature trees tend to be warmer than their tree-lined counterparts [ 59]. It is\\nwarmer on barren ground than in irrigated areas and it is warmer on artiﬁcial turf pitches\\nthan on grass grounds. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a metric for measuring the impact of\\ntrees on urban surface temperatures. This establishes a connection between the amount of\\ngreenery present and the amount of water lost to evaporation in urban settings [60]. Several\\nfactors, including tree species, age, hydraulic state, vapor pressure deﬁcit, soil nutrient\\navailability, seasonal changes, groundwater conditions, and wind speed, all play a part in\\ndetermining the LAI [61].\\nThere are techniques to include water storage in paving systems, allowing for the use\\nof evaporative cooling on roads, parking areas, and sidewalks [62]. Cooler temperatures\\nare maintained on water-retentive pavements because less solar energy is converted to\\nheat through conduction. There are several types of water-repellent pavements, including\\nporous pavers, permeable pavers, and pervious pavers [ 63]. Water permeates porous\\npavers through tiny holes in their surface. These pavers typically include a cellular grid\\ndesign, and the holes within the grid are ﬁlled with moisture-retaining materials [64]. Grass',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 12 of 26\\nis a great choice for inﬁll because it promotes transpiration from the root to the shoot of\\nthe plant and brings moisture from the ground up to the surface, where it can evaporate\\nand cool the pavements below [65]. In contrast to previous and porous choices, permeable\\npavers allow water to ﬂow over their surface rather than through them and are made from\\nconcrete or kiln-ﬁred clay bricks [66]. In order to facilitate the evaporation of surface water,\\na path is made between pavers by the use of spacer lugs or small holes. It was about as\\nwarm as concrete during the day and about as cool as asphalt at night, making this paver\\nan ideal alternative. It follows that the evaporative cooling effect of permeable pavers\\nis marginal.\\n4. Sustainable Materials for UHI Effect Mitigation\\nThe incorporation of sustainable building materials into the built environment is\\nanother key contributor to the UHI impact. The building’s preconstruction, construction,\\nand ﬁnishing materials all contribute considerably. Streets and pavements composed of\\nimpermeable and highly heat-absorbent materials, painting materials with high thermal\\neffects, and utility efﬁciency appliances that release high heat and GHGs contribute sig-\\nniﬁcantly to UHI effects. Sustainable construction materials are not only economically\\nfeasible but also minimize harmful emissions and UHI effects, hence minimizing the total\\nenvironmental impact. Buildings should make use of environmentally friendly building\\nmaterials and technologies in a manner that is suitable and contextual. Locally made or\\nobtained construction materials qualify as sustainable. These items comprise recycled and\\nindustrial byproducts and waste materials. Sustainable materials are thermally efﬁcient\\nand have a lesser environmental effect. The manufacturing of these building materials takes\\nmuch less energy than the production of contemporary or conventional building materials.\\n4.1. Innovative Streets and Pavement Systems\\nThe idea of adopting novel pavements to reduce the UHI effect has gained popu-\\nlarity in recent years in highly populated regions. In order to produce cool pavements,\\nconventional pavements may make use of already available pavement technologies by\\nmodifying the materials, implementing sustainable strategies, or introducing brand-new\\nmaterials [67,68]. If a pavement increases solar reﬂectance ability, increases the evapora-\\ntion process, or decreases the release of sensible heat into the urban atmosphere, then it\\nwill remain cooler than traditional pavement [53]. Cool pavements are categorized into\\nreﬂective, evaporative, and heat-harvesting pavements [62]. In order to reduce the surface\\ntemperature and sensible heat emission, reﬂective pavements have a higher albedo than\\nregular pavements. Evaporative pavements are those that retain water at the surface or in\\nthe subsurface for the purpose of evaporative cooling. Subduing the surface temperature,\\nheat-harvesting pavements collect energy from the sun and use it for other purposes. The\\ntopic of cool pavements has expanded beyond pavement cooling technology to include the\\nimpact of such pavements on the weather in cities [69].\\nPaving materials that are designed to keep temperatures down, such as those that\\nare reﬂective of light, increase the rate at which water evaporates or have some other\\ncooling effect [ 70]. It will always be colder than standard asphalt, and it will radiate\\nless heat into the atmosphere. Since the hottest time of the day typically occurs in the\\nsummer, when the release of sensible heat is crucial to the formation of the UHI, a cool\\npavement must be able to reduce its daily maximum temperature [ 29]. Pavements that\\nhave been sealed with a material that is reﬂective of light will have less of an impact on the\\nenvironment [71]. A sealed surface is created by pressing ﬁnely graded aggregates into a\\nthin layer of hot bitumen that has been spread over an existing pavement [61]. Due to the\\naggregates being partly exposed, the surface albedo should be somewhere between that\\nof the asphalt binder and that of the aggregates themselves [72]. Solar reﬂection is shown\\nto be highly dependent on the aggregate’s color and the pavement’s age [73]. Chip seal\\npavement’s albedo is observed to decline with age yet remains higher than that of regular\\nasphalt concrete [74]. Although generating white slurry seal requires re-formulating the',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 13 of 26\\nemulsiﬁer and increasing the price, it has limited applications because of the increased\\nalbedo the pavement receives from it [ 75]. It is also possible to greatly improve asphalt\\npavement’s reﬂectivity by the use of other methods, such as painting with light colors or\\nmicro surfacing with light-colored materials [76].\\nIncorporating white cementitious materials and light-colored pebbles into concrete\\nmixes can create highly reﬂective pavements [ 77]. The albedo of hydrated concrete is\\nprincipally determined by the cement’s solar reﬂectance, with other ingredients playing a\\nsupporting role. Although the addition of ﬂy ash, which reacts with calcium hydroxide to\\nproduce stronger concrete, can decrease albedo slightly, it can also increase longevity [78].\\nThe solar reﬂecting ability can be altered by a wetting, soiling, and abrasion process after\\nbeing exposed [ 79]. The reﬂectivity of the ﬁne aggregates and paste is what primarily\\ndetermines the albedo in the aged state. High reﬂectivity can also be seen in white topping\\nand roller-compacted pavements. Streets with minimal trafﬁc in urban areas may have a\\nwhite overlay of only two to four inches thick [80].\\nAlthough reﬂective pavements keep the heat off in the summer, they can have the\\nopposite effect in the winter by making the road surface colder [81]. During the summer, a\\npavement surface with high reﬂection is preferable, while a surface with low reﬂectance\\nduring the winter is preferable. Due to a reversible molecular structure transition that\\noccurs at elevated temperatures, the albedo of thermochromic materials shifts when their\\nsurfaces warm and cool [ 82]. Thermochromic substances and their doses can affect the\\ntransition temperature. Adding TiO 2 to this thermochromic coating could increase its\\nreﬂectivity [ 83]. When thermochromic pigments were added to asphalt binder, it was\\ndiscovered that the binder retained its temperature more effectively in both hot and cold\\nclimates [84]. Similarly, it was discovered that cement paste with thermochromic pigments\\ncould maintain a colder temperature in hot conditions and a warmer temperature in cold\\nenvironments than plain concrete paste [65]. Thermochromic materials can be impregnated\\ninto concrete; however, this process may reduce the concrete’s strength.\\nTherefore, the ability of permeable pavement to maintain a low temperature depends\\non whether or not the evaporative ﬂux is greater than the extra heat uptake brought about\\nby the pavement’s low thermal inertia [85]. A pervious paver is a porous concrete that\\nallows water to ﬂow through it instead of collecting and pooling on the surface. Large,\\nuniform-sized aggregates are coated with a concrete paste or asphalt binder to create\\npervious concrete [86]. Since the pavement systems drain easily, the permeable pavers in\\nthis concrete do not collect or hold too much percolating water. Pervious pavements have\\nbeen found to be as hot as black asphalt pavements on sunny summer days because of their\\nhigher solar radiation absorption and lower heat inertia than conventional pavements [87].\\nPervious pavements may be considered cool pavements due to their lower temperature at\\nnight and their ability to cool faster than regular concrete. This is because the roughness\\nof the pervious surface reduces its albedo, allowing it to soak up more solar energy than\\nregular concrete would. When compared to conventional concrete pavement, pervious\\nconcrete pavement has a lower solar reﬂectance index [ 88]. When compared to regular\\nconcrete, pervious concrete is reported to have a lower thermal inertia. The texture of\\npervious concrete is coarser than that of regular concrete. With a higher heat convective\\ncoefﬁcient, this concrete could be more effective in dissipating heat in breezy conditions [89].\\nUnless the pervious concrete is re-wetted at a suitable time, the evaporation of the\\npreceding concrete adds relatively little to the decrease in surface temperature [90]. Too\\nmuch water seeps through pervious concrete too quickly for it to be effective at prevent-\\ning evaporation. Adequate water is required for evaporative cooling and water-holding\\npavements, which retain most of their moisture in the surface layer [76]. Water-retentive\\npavements differ from permeable pavements in their pore structure and evaporative ca-\\npacity. Water-retentive ﬁllers are often incorporated into concrete to increase its capacity\\nto store water. A water-retentive pavement is one that, when saturated, can hold onto\\nrainwater for a period of time by using speciﬁc ﬁller materials [91]. In addition, when the\\nevaporated water close to the surface is gone, the water-retentive ﬁller’s pore structure',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 14 of 26\\ncan draw water from the base via capillary force. After being watered, the dry surface of a\\nwater-retentive block can absorb water at a rate greater than its absorptivity [65]. Reﬁlling\\nwater-retentive pavements with wastewater is one strategy for increasing their resistance\\nto evaporation [92]. Wastewater is sprinkled on water-retentive pavements in some places\\nto extend the cooling effect of evaporation. The use of high absorptive inﬁll and recycled\\nwater for irrigation both assist keep pavements at a more comfortable temperature than the\\nvegetation around them [93].\\n4.2. Various Coating Materials\\n4.2.1. Painting with Light-Colored Materials\\nOne potential solution to the UHI effect is the use of solar-reﬂective coatings for the\\nbuilding envelope [94]. Extensive global modeling and ﬁeld studies have conﬁrmed that\\nhighly reﬂective materials, when combined with thermal energy storage and conservation\\nmeasures, are an effective strategy to combat the UHI effect [95]. Traditional cool materials\\nwith diffuse reﬂectance do not appear to resolve concerns connected to rising urban density,\\nsuch as the proximity of buildings and canyon phenomena [96]. As a matter of fact, with a\\ndiffusive nature, some of the reﬂection will be absorbed by nearby structures. The favorable\\neffect they have on UHIs is also mitigated since reﬂected radiation from diffuse vertical\\nsurfaces is absorbed more strongly by pavements and roads [ 97]. The ability of retro-\\nreﬂective (RR) materials to redirect light to their original source is a useful and unique\\nattribute. RR materials are now used for trafﬁc safety applications such as road signs and\\nwork clothing but are not commercially available for use as building coatings [98]. Coating\\nurban patterns with RR materials may mitigate UHIs by reducing the amount of sunlight\\nthat is reﬂected to nearby structures and roads [99].\\nCurrently, high reﬂectance coatings made from acrylic materials, elastomeric, sili-\\ncone, ﬂuoropolymer, or mixtures thereof, are widely utilized globally to mitigate the UHI\\nimpact [8]. Several highly reﬂective artiﬁcial coatings may be far cooler than naturally oc-\\ncurring white materials but still a few degrees warmer than the ambient temperature [100].\\nThe solar reﬂectance, emissivity value, and thermal capacity of white reﬂective materials\\nall contribute to the surface temperature range that these materials exhibit. Hence, most\\nwhite reﬂective coatings deteriorate and lose their luster, which is a major issue for the\\nindustry [101]. A further problem with white coatings is that they allow bacteria to multiply\\nrapidly on the surface [102]. Roof washing can restore some of the rooﬁng material’s optical\\nqualities but may reduce its reﬂectivity. White reﬂective coatings lose their reﬂectivity\\nmonths to years after they are applied.\\nMany factors, including the coatings’ composition and treatment, as well as the sur-\\nrounding environment, affect optical performance and the likelihood of an increase in\\noptical durability [103]. Compared to white paints made with organic binders, those made\\nwith inorganic components are more optically stable and have higher solar reﬂectance and\\nemissivity. It has been discovered that doping titanium dioxide with Al, Li, or K signiﬁ-\\ncantly improves the photostability of the coatings without affecting their reﬂectance [ 8].\\nThe coatings’ self-cleaning characteristics and optical performance are both improved by\\nthe incorporation of photocatalytic technology. When titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles\\nare incorporated into a coating, the deposited organic substances are broken down into\\nsulfate, water, nitrate, and carbon dioxide, which are then washed off by water cleaning\\nor rain [104].\\nThis drastically reduces the adhesion of bacteria to the coating’s surface. The surface\\ntemperatures of white, man-made materials with high reﬂectivity and emissivity are only\\nslightly higher than the surrounding air temperature. Since they dramatically lower the\\nemission of sensible heat into the atmosphere, they are very helpful in preventing cities from\\nbecoming uncomfortably hot. An important downside of highly reﬂecting white materials\\nis that their optical and thermal performance may degrade signiﬁcantly with age [ 105].\\nThere are a variety of mitigation solutions that make use of commercially available colored,\\nspectrally selective materials with high spectral reﬂectivity in the near-infrared wavelength',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 15 of 26\\nrange and a high emissivity value. Materials that reﬂect infrared rays have a much higher\\nsolar reﬂectance compared to materials of the same color and type [106].\\nTo boost reﬂectivity, scientists have turned to polymeric inorganic hybrid materials and\\norganic or inorganic pigments with near-infrared spectrum reﬂectivity [107]. Pigments that\\nreﬂect infrared light and are made from inorganic materials have superior optical stability,\\ngreat durability, and high temperature stability. Heavy metals in pigments could be bad for\\nthe environment. For the most part, the melt blending procedures of polymeric inorganic\\nhybrid materials are less harmful to the environment [108]. Infrared-reﬂecting pigments\\ncan be used with any solvent, including those used to dissolve polyesters, ﬂuoropolymers,\\nand acrylics, as well as those used in water-based coating chemistry [109]. When pigments\\nare combined with binders and other compounds, a coating can be created. It is reﬂective\\nbecause the coating’s pigment has a different refractive index in the infrared spectrum than\\nthe binder.\\nOn the other hand, if the coating’s transparency to infrared (IR) radiation is not af-\\nfected by the difference between the IR refractive indexes of the pigment and binder, then\\nthe coating will be transparent to IR radiation [110]. When trying to generate a reﬂective\\nsurface, infrared reﬂective coatings can be put directly over any material, while infrared-\\ntransmitting coatings require a near-infrared reﬂecting background. A near-infrared trans-\\nmission coating can be applied when the substrate has a high IR reﬂectance; however, a\\nwhite basecoat and an IR-transmitting coating can be applied instead when the substrate is\\nabsorbing [111]. The reﬂectance of the substrate, the thickness of the coating, the roughness\\nof the surface, and the possible backscattering of the pigments all play major roles in\\ndetermining the composite material’s spectral reﬂectance [112].\\nThe optical properties of the pigments, binder refractive index, pigment volume\\nconcentration, and particle size all have a role in regulating this. However, the near-infrared\\n(NIR) and solar reﬂectance of cool coatings are observed to increase with the thickness of\\nthe white base coat and can reach a maximum constant value above a speciﬁc thickness,\\nsuggesting that smoothing the rough surface of the materials boosts reﬂectivity across\\nall wavelengths. Rooﬁng and paving materials can receive IR reﬂective coatings [ 113].\\nIR--reﬂecting materials have a far lower surface temperature than traditional materials\\nof the same color, allowing for less sensible heat to be released and signiﬁcantly less\\nurban hyperthermia as a result [114]. The emittance and solar reﬂectance of IR-reﬂecting\\nmaterials exposed to the external environment are diminished due to weathering, aging,\\nand soiling [115].\\n4.2.2. Phase-Change Materials (PCMs)\\nAnother tactic for minimizing the UHI effect is the use of PCMs that store and re-\\nlease latent heat to boost the apparent thermal capacity of buildings and urban structures\\nand lower their peak surface temperatures. Most PCMs are noncorrosive, nontoxic, and\\ncompatible with a wide range of other materials used in asphalt and concrete pavement\\nand rooﬁng goods, and they can be categorized as either organic, inorganic, or eutectic\\nmixes [116]. With the help of PCMs, asphaltic pavements are less likely to experience\\nthermally-induced rutting and cracking, and the viscoelastic qualities of asphalt binders\\nare less likely to degrade [8]. Concrete pavements’ resistance to cracking, curling strains,\\nhydration processes, and thermal shrinkage can all be enhanced by using PCMs [117]. It is\\nfeasible to reduce the surface temperature of pavements and release the stored energy at a\\nlater time by including PCMs within the pavement’s mass [118].\\nThe amount of PCMs in the entire mixture, the phase-change materials employed, the\\nmethod used to incorporate PCMs into the pavement, the thermal and optical characteristics\\nof the pavement materials, and the local climatic circumstances all inﬂuence how much the\\nsurface temperature can be lowered [119]. The thermal capacity and the heat transmission\\nquality of the pavements are both affected by the volume percentage of the PCMs [ 120].\\nBecause of the low conductivity in the liquid phase, PCMs impede heat transfer in the mass\\nof the pavement, leading to higher surface temperatures even as their presence in the mix',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 16 of 26\\nincreases the possibility for latent heat storage and hence reduces surface temperatures [94].\\nChoosing the PCM melting point is important because it determines how long it takes to\\nheat up the pavement to its maximum temperature and how fast it cools down again [121].\\nThe melting temperature selection should be based on the local climate and the thermal\\nbalance of the pavement [122]. It is possible to use many PCMs, some of which have quite\\nvaried melting points. When used in construction or urban planning materials, PCMs\\npose a serious leakage danger when in their molten condition [123]. Micro-encapsulation,\\nmacro-encapsulation, and porous inclusion are among the preferred ways of putting them\\ninto construction materials [119].\\n4.2.3. Color-Changing Materials\\nMaterials that undergo a thermochromic color change in response to temperature can,\\nfor example, be bright and reﬂective in the summer and dark and absorbing in the win-\\nter. A wide variety of thermochromic materials, including thermochromic combinations,\\nwith a wide range of color-changing mechanisms, are known. Sol-gel ﬁlms’ lumines-\\ncence shifts [124], surface plasmon absorption [125], liquid–crystal phase transitions [126],\\ndye–dye and dye–polymer aggregation and disaggregation mechanisms [127], photonic\\ncrystals’ refractive index modulation [128], and pH changes [129] are the most common ex-\\namples of the many known mechanisms. Thermochromic pigments and leuco dyes require\\nthe use of three distinct components: a solvent that regulates the color-change temperature;\\na color former such as spirolactone, spiropyran, triphenylmethane, or ﬂuorane; and a color\\ndeveloper [130]. At the melting point of the thermochromic substance, the solvent turns\\nfrom a solid to a liquid, allowing the developer and the color former to dissolve into it [131].\\nThermochromic systems lose their color when the hydrogen bonds between the solvent\\nand the color former are severed [132]. In thermochromic materials, the solvent reverts to\\nthe solid phase and the color former regains its original color when the temperature drops\\nbelow the freezing point [133]. Leuco dyes’ color transition temperature is easily modiﬁable\\nby experimenting with various dyes and solvents. By combining different thermochromic\\ningredients, it is possible to create thermochromic mixes with more than one color change.\\nWithout damaging their color-changing characteristics, the composites can change from\\ngray to pink, green to blue, and white at temperatures close to 24 ◦C [8]. It is the molar\\nratios of the three components in the thermochromic mixture, as well as their chemical\\nproperties, that determine the color quality and thermochromic qualities of leuco dye-based\\nmaterials [134]. Important issues with aging arise with thermochromic materials based on\\nthe use of leuco dyes because of fading and the loss of reversibility. Molecular oxygen is\\nreduced and reactive oxygen species are produced in an irreversible photochemical process\\ntriggered by ultraviolet (UV) radiation [135]. There is a great possibility for mitigation in\\nthe built environment from thermochromic materials.\\n4.2.4. Fluorescence Materials\\nOne of the creative strategies that may be used in UHI impact mitigation procedures\\nis to capture the photovoltaic energy of solar radiation, release the light emission, and\\naid in increasing the surface’s ability to reﬂect light [ 8]. There are two different kinds\\nof ﬂuorescent substances: bulk ﬂuorescent substances like ruby and nano-ﬂuorescent\\nsubstances like quantum dots [134]. Combining a polymer with a colloidal quantum dot\\nsolution is an alternate method for depositing quantum dots on a substrate. By using this\\nmethod, the danger of luminous deterioration brought on by the aggregation of quantum\\ndots is reduced [136]. Quantum dots and ﬂuorescent materials offer a great opportunity to\\nreduce the UHI effect.\\nSome pigments have shown promise for effective ﬂuorescence and look to be econom-\\nically and enduringly viable. Ruby, an aluminum oxide pigment with chromium added,\\nwas the ﬁrst of its kind. It is useful for making things in shades of red and pink [ 137].\\nAnother option is calcium copper tetra-silicate with either barium (Ba) or strontium (Sr) in\\nplace of the calcium, the ﬁnest results to yet have been obtained with calcium and strontium',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 17 of 26\\ncompounds [138]. The near-infrared ﬂuorescence is preserved throughout the mixing pro-\\ncess. A coating of synthetic rubies, with its rich dark red hue and ﬂuorescence advantage,\\nis a positive sight [139]. These pigments are alkaline earth copper silicates, which are often\\nmanufactured using solid-state chemical methods. In a nutshell, the oxides or carbonates of\\nthe component metals are well mixed and then heated in air to a temperature approaching\\n900 ◦C for a few hours [140]. It is common for the dark compound copper oxide to remain\\nas an impurity after the synthesis. The pigment will be gray instead of blue if there is an\\nexcess of copper oxide [141].\\n4.3. Use of Energy-Efﬁcient Appliances\\nThe energy used by buildings and the one-third of all GHG emissions they account for\\nare both signiﬁcant contributors to UHIs. Reducing energy consumption and running costs\\nand lowering greenhouse gas emissions across the life cycle of buildings requires proper\\nbuilding design and construction, the sufﬁcient use of energy sources, and the discovery of\\ninnovative materials [142]. Climate parameters and climate zones are crucial in adjusting\\nto and minimizing the impacts of UHIs since they inﬂuence so many elements of building\\ndesign and operation [ 143]. New energy budgets must be established, and the energy\\nefﬁciency of buildings and whole cities must be improved. Taking climate dynamism into\\nconsideration throughout the building design process is crucial because it allows for more\\naccurate sizing of residential hot water, heating, and cooling systems, as well as more\\nthoughtful material selection [144]. To achieve a building design that reduces the negative\\nimpacts of UHI while still adapting to the urban environment, codes and standards must\\nbe ﬂexible enough to accommodate changing circumstances.\\nThus, it is important to establish new climatic zones and formulate suggestions to\\nprovide appropriate thermal conditions for future epochs. The construction industry\\nhas a unique potential to cut down on waste disposal and resource consumption via\\nthe development of economically and ecologically sustainable materials based on the\\nintegration of secondary materials as alternatives. Appliances that reduce energy use have\\nan enormous impact on these two important environmental goals. Materials that quickly\\ndisperse energy are highly valued in the quest for efﬁciency and the mitigation of carbon\\nemissions. However, domestic energy savings are reliant on users’ technical and habitual\\nbehavior; in fact, energy-efﬁcient home appliances provide better energy efﬁciency and\\nsustainability than the habitual adjustment of turning off appliances when not in use [145].\\n5. Challenges in Implementing UHI Mitigation Strategies\\nDespite the fact that a great deal of work is being done to ﬁnd solutions to the problem\\nof the UHI in highly urbanized regions where environmental concerns are paramount,\\nthere are still certain practical limitations that are encountered by the initiators. The lack of\\ngovernment legislation, inadequate technology, an inaccurate estimate of the economic ad-\\nvantages, and reluctance on the part of individuals are all examples of these limitations. The\\nlargest problem is the government’s lack of policies aimed at reducing UHIs and providing\\ndirection to those who would want to implement such efforts. As previously indicated,\\ngovernment policies are the single most effective tool for advancing urban sustainability\\nprograms [146]. Yet, ineffective government initiatives may dampen public excitement.\\nHowever, while being aware of the environmental, economic, and social advantages\\nof implementing sustainable initiatives in a voluntary manner, developers and private\\nsectors sometimes ﬁnd it difﬁcult to use newly offered technology. The failure to regularly\\nupdate the local experience and feedback report is also cited as a serious challenge. Despite\\nthe obvious advantages to business, local governments in certain nations continue to\\nenact policies that are harmful to the environment [147]. Companies in the private sector\\nare often hesitant to take on such initiatives because they fear failure in the absence of\\nadequate government oversight and funding [ 148]. Although there has been a lot of\\nattention on innovation and technical progress in the research studies, there are still several\\ntechnological roadblocks that prevent widespread implementation. While each city has',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 18 of 26\\nits own unique characteristics from its climate to its high concentration of urban features,\\ndifferent applications must be adapted to work in each one.\\nBuilding characteristics, roof pitches, plant types, and other accessibility variables\\nall put constraints on the available options. To provide one example, the roofs of older\\nbuildings are not designed to support considerable weight; therefore, only a large system\\nwith low structural loading may be employed. However, the lightweight and expansive\\nmechanism is unable to withstand much wind. Furthermore, urban ﬂoods, the UHI phe-\\nnomena, and the diminishment of urban landscapes are all primarily driven by the growth\\nin buildings and pavement. Numerous cities are dominated by skyscrapers; however, these\\nstructures almost never have any roof space left over for greenery because of the presence\\nof expensive and necessary construction services. In addition, green roof plants may attract\\nmosquitoes and other pests, which can cause problems for nearby households. Metals\\nlike aluminum, copper, zinc, and iron, used in rooﬁng, may contribute to environmental\\ndegradation if they are not used appropriately [149].\\nMany advantages, including those related to protecting the environment, enhancing\\nbiodiversity, and enhancing occupants’ quality of life, cannot be evaluated in terms of\\neconomic returns and hence act as a barrier to adoption by developers and the private sector.\\nHowever, there are challenges in calculating the economic advantages of UHI reduction\\nowing to a lack of appropriate resources and improper auditing methods. Meanwhile,\\nprices increase. The upfront costs of designing, building, maintaining, and watering\\nsuch a roof might be more than conventional roofs [ 34]. Dislike might emerge from\\na lack of understanding and knowledge about the repayment time frame. Economic\\ngains are complicated by the widely varying lengths of time it takes to get a return on\\ninvestment [150]. The time it takes to recoup the investment made in a large project is a\\ndrawback despite the fact that it may ultimately save money [151]. A major roadblock is the\\nreluctance of designers and developers to implement new tactics, mostly due to concerns\\nthat locals will not like them and the resulting excess of unnecessary space. This issue\\nemphasizes the need for a more informed and supportive public.\\n6. Discussion\\nThe UHI effect and its harmful effects from built environments inside urban areas\\nwere detailed in this study. It is obvious that the conventional methods of construction\\nand the rapidly rising number of buildings in urban areas have exacerbated environmental\\nchallenges. Multiple initiatives are now conducting research and development to identify\\nthe optimal solution for low-impact architecture and design of buildings and built envi-\\nronments that will also minimize the UHI effect. This research focused on two primary\\nstrategies: the incorporation of green infrastructure into the built environment and its\\ncomponents and the use of sustainable materials in buildings. Green infrastructure, such as\\ngreen roofs, green façades, green parking, green roadways, and green pavements, were con-\\nsidered and examined. Incorporating plants and the evapotranspiration of plants, reducing\\nthe heat impact and increasing the cooling nature of the environment, and also adding\\nvalue to the green space and protecting the ecosystem, green rooﬁng has been identiﬁed as\\na potential solution to conventional rooﬁng systems by attaching plants and regulating the\\nthermal effect within the building interior and the near surroundings of the building.\\nHowever, this has also brought about some unfavorable outcomes, such as providing a\\nsafe haven for insects and certain dangerous reptiles and necessitating the implementation\\nof remedies to problems like water leaks and root penetration in the structure. In contrast,\\ngreen façades use the vertical surface area of the structure and may be used without\\naffecting the building’s performance. Similar to green roofs, green walls and living walls\\nare a kind of vertical garden seen on high-rise buildings. Others are framed and connected\\nto the buildings rather than the façades themselves. Green rooﬁng and other forms of direct\\nfaçade attachment have been linked to structural damage and water leakage, although\\nthese problems may be mitigated if the right preventative measures and repair methods',\n",
       " 'Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 19 of 26\\nare used [152]. However, such damage caused by plants may be avoided in the case of\\nframe-supported façades, although doing so may lead to increased expenses.\\nIt is true that the designers of sustainable green buildings are being urged to cut\\ndown on parking spaces in an effort to limit the number of individual vehicles used.\\nHowever, in certain circumstances, parking spaces are essential and the number of vehicles\\nis unavoidable due to insufﬁcient public transit options. With the use of tree canopies\\nand highly reﬂecting indexing paint, parking lots may be made more environmentally\\nfriendly and less detrimental to the environment. This will cause plants to produce a\\ncooling action known as evapotranspiration. Pavement and road designs that include\\nvegetation to minimize heat gain, promote water inﬁltration and percolation, and decrease\\nthe UHI impact are preferable from an environmental and economic perspective. The heat\\nabsorption of a building and the UHI effect are both largely attributable to the materials\\nused in construction [143]. The thermal impact of the materials, including their absorption\\nand reﬂection of heat, must be carefully examined throughout the construction process.\\nUsing sustainable construction practices and sustainable building materials in high-rise\\nstructures is the most effective way to mitigate the UHI impact. By using highly reﬂective\\npaint, you may limit the amount of heat absorbed by a building’s exterior.\\nIncorporating phase-change materials into construction allows for the absorption\\nand storage of thermal energy through a phase transition. Because of this, the ambient\\ntemperature drops. Color-changing materials can be white during times of high solar\\nradiation, increasing reﬂectivity and decreasing heat gain, and black during times of low\\nsolar radiation and low temperatures inside the building, absorbing heat and lowering the\\nneed for heating, both of which help to lower GHG emissions and the UHI. By doing so,\\nthe ﬂuorescence effect is achieved and the heat gain of the building is decreased thanks to\\nthe incorporation of ﬂuorescence materials into the building components. GHG emissions\\nmay be lowered and energy use can be lowered by using appliances that are more energy-\\nefﬁcient. In this way, it is not only worthwhile but also economically useful, and it helps\\nto mitigate the UHI impact. While all of these green infrastructures and materials have\\nhelped with UHI reduction and mitigation measures, there are several obstacles to their\\nwidespread use in tall buildings that must be overcome. A lack of government regulation,\\npoor technology, an overestimation of economic beneﬁts, and individual hesitation are all\\nfactors holding progress back. Sustainable built environments in dense urban settings will\\npave the way for environmental friendliness, a lesser UHI effect, and comfort for occupants\\nand other living beings and integrated ecosystems in the future by ﬁxing the problems and\\nmaking it accessible to anyone, anywhere in the globe.\\n7. Conclusions\\nThis article compares and analyzes many cutting-edge strategies for decreasing the\\nnegative impacts of UHIs. The use of green rooﬁng systems, green façades, and green\\nparking, pavement, and streets in place of traditional nature enhances the amount of green\\nspace, aids in the implementation of heat reduction measures, and lessens the impact on\\nthe environment through the cooling effect of metabolic processes. Green walls provide a\\nviable alternative and a large canvas on which to grow vegetation vertically. Sustainable\\ngreenery mitigation measures will be bolstered by the replacement of roads and pavements\\nfor walkers in highly urbanized areas with green installations. To further minimize solar\\nradiation absorption and boost surface heat, shading arrangements and coating materials\\nwith specialized functions like white coloring, PCMs, color changes, and ﬂuorescence need\\nto be implemented.\\nThe adoption of energy-efﬁcient appliances is an important step in mitigating the\\neffects of global warming caused by the production of GHGs and limiting the rise in global\\nsurface temperature. The buildings, parks, water features, roadways, and recreational\\nspaces that make up urban areas will vary from one location to the other. Depending\\non the type of building (such as residential, hotel, industrial, ofﬁce, and retail complex\\nbuildings), many greening initiatives and methods may be viable to execute. This study’s',\n",

Hence, there are numerous\\nchallenges that must be overcome before this idea can be used on a global scale, but doing\\nso will help to move closer to an environment where UHIs have less of an impact and,\\nhopefully, eventually have no effect at all. This is true on a local as well as global scale, and\\nit may be achieved via the implementation of efﬁcient laws and regulations, the discovery\\nof new methods for handling existing problems, and the sharing of the ﬁndings of relevant\\nresearch and development initiatives.\\nThe key ﬁndings from this review are listed below:\\n• The rapidly urbanizing cities around the world necessitate ecologically mindful and\\nsustainable ways to build.\\n• The UHI effect is a critical urban phenomenon; however, adequate mitigation efforts will\\nlessen the effects on the environment as well as on the safety and health of inhabitants.\\n• Infrastructure and building materials as well as greening the built environment are\\ncrucial in managing UHIs.\\n• New and existing buildings should include infrastructure with green roofs, walls,\\nfaçades, green parking, water retaining pavements, and shaded roadways, which have\\nproven beneﬁts toward mitigating UHIs.\\n• The incorporation of sustainable and environmentally friendly materials into the built\\nenvironment, such as innovative street and pavement systems, a variety of coating\\nmaterials, and the use of energy-efﬁcient appliances, has provided a number of beneﬁts\\nand been proven to be highly effective in lowering the UHI effect.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.M.M.I., H.-W.C., M.M.F.S. and E.J.; methodology,\\nA.M.M.I., H.-W.C., N.M. and E.J.; validation, H.-W.C., C.Y.W., N.M. and E.J., formal analysis,\\nA.M.M.I.; investigation, A.M.M.I.; resources, A.M.M.I., H.-W.C. and E.J.; data curation, A.M.M.I.;\\nwriting—original draft preparation, A.M.M.I.; writing—review and editing, H.-W.C., N.M. and E.J.;\\nvisualization, A.M.M.I. supervision, H.-W.C., N.M. and E.J.; project administration, A.M.M.I.; funding\\nacquisition, H.-W.C., N.M. and E.J.

       " 'FOREWORD\\nVICECHAIRMAN\\nTamil Nadu’s urban areas, especially in densely populated cities like\\nChennai, face major challenges from rapid urbanization, climate change,\\nand increasing risks to disasters. Heat is a serious invisible disaster. Urban\\nHeat Island Effect (UHIE) is a phenomenon where urban areas experiencing\\nsignificantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural regions due to\\nhuman activity, extensive buildings, and limited green spaces. This effect\\nintensifies heat levels, impacting public health, increasing energy demand,\\nand reducing urban comfort. \\nOur State is dedicated to addressing these impacts through a\\ncomprehensive strategy, including the pioneering step of notifying heat as a\\nstate specific disaster.  Early in 2024, the State Planning Commission had\\nprepared a report on Tamil Nadu Heat Mitigation Strategy. Further, to\\nsupport urban resilience, the State Planning Commission, through the Tamil\\nNadu State Land Use Research Board, has been conducting extensive\\nstudies. This is one of the notable studies, supported by United Nations\\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), and CEPT University, focuses on analyzing\\nUrban Heat Island vulnerability. The findings identify vulnerable hotspots\\nacross Tamil Nadu and recommends targeted adaptive interventions,\\nfostering a more integrated approach to urban resilience in the state. This\\nstrategic approach enables the State in prioritization of resources and\\ntargeted adaptation measures in the most affected regions, ensuring a\\nproactive and focused response to climate change challenges.\\nSTATE PLANNING COMMISSION Dr. J. Jeyaranjan',\n",
       " 'EXECUTIVE\\nSUMMARY\\nThe intensifying heat resulting from climate change presents serious risks to\\nhealth, food security, water availability, and economic productivity. The 2024\\nreport, Countdown on Health and Climate Change, published by The Lancet,\\nhighlights the increasing health threats associated with climate change\\nworldwide, with India among the most severely impacted. In response to these\\nescalating risks, the Tamil Nadu State Planning Commission with the Tamil Nadu\\nState Land Use Research Board, in collaboration with the United Nations\\nEnvironment Programme, and CEPT University, has developed the “Urban Heat\\nIsland - Hotspot Analysis and Mitigation Strategies for Tamil Nadu”  offering a\\nstructured approach to understanding & reducing urban heat impacts.  The report\\nbuilds upon the foundation laid by the Tamil Nadu Heat Mitigation Strategy, which\\nhighlights the intensifying challenges posed by extreme and prolonged heat\\nwaves in the state. With temperatures frequently exceeding the comfortable\\nrange of 25-30°C at 60% humidity, Tamil Nadu’s population, ecosystems, and\\ninfrastructure are increasingly vulnerable to heat stress. Nearly 59% of the\\npopulation experiences temperatures above 35°C, underscoring the urgency of\\nheat resilience measures as climate change heightens these risks. To address\\nthese challenges, Tamil Nadu has established the Heat Action Network to facilitate\\ninter-departmental and intersectoral collaboration, ensuring an evidence-driven\\nand comprehensive response to heat mitigation.\\nThe Urban Heat Island - Hotspot Analysis and Mitigation Strategies report provides\\na focused analysis of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects across Tamil Nadu,\\nidentifying the areas where urbanization and climate change intersect to create\\nlocalized heat stress. The report consists of two primary components: “State-level\\nand District-level urban heat zones” and “City-level hotspot analysis.” followed by\\nrecommendations for mitigation. The first part offers a statewide perspective,\\nmapping heat zones across Tamil Nadu to pinpoint high-risk areas and guiding\\nfuture land use planning. By creating a district-level heat map, the report aims to\\nhelp Tamil Nadu plan strategically for urban resilience, targeting resources and\\ninterventions where they are most needed.',\n",
       " 'Over the past 20 years, the report notes a trend of\\nincreasing night-time temperatures in Tamil Nadu, with a\\n59% rise in areas experiencing night temperatures of 24-\\n26°C, while extreme daytime temperatures (46-50°C)\\nhave decreased by 28%. This pattern suggests that dense\\nurban areas, particularly Chennai, retain heat overnight,\\nintensifying Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. Key hotspots\\ninclude Thoothukkudi, which records the highest daytime\\ntemperatures, and Chennai, significantly affected by\\nincreased night-time heat. UHI intensity has risen by\\nnearly 3°C in cities like Chennai and Thiruvallur, driven by\\ndense urban development and reduced green cover.\\nThe second component, Identification and Assessment of\\nHotspots Across Urban Areas of Tamil Nadu and followed\\nby Recommendations for Managing UHIE Mitigation, maps\\nUHI hotspots across the state using land classifications—\\nbuilt-up areas, vegetation, water bodies, and barren land.\\nEmploying Land Use and Cover (LULC) indicators, the\\nanalysis reveals how urbanization affects surface\\ntemperatures. Temporal analysis from 2013 to 2023, using\\nlandscape indices such as NDVI (vegetation), NDBI (built-\\nup), and MNDWI (water), shows that urban expansion\\nheightens UHI effects, especially in Thoothukkudi, Chennai,\\nand Madurai, where reduced green spaces and increased\\nconstruction have raised night-time temperatures.\\nCity-specific assessments reveal varied temperature\\ndistributions tied to land characteristics, with Madurai’s\\ndense urban areas correlating with higher temperatures,\\nwhile coastal Thoothukkudi shows temperature ranges\\ninfluenced by natural heat sinks.\\nTo mitigate UHI effects, the report recommends\\nincreasing urban green cover through forestry and green\\ncorridors, adopting cool pavements and reflective\\nmaterials, and restoring natural heat sinks like water\\nbodies. At the building level, climate-sensitive designs,\\ngreen roofs, and energy-efficient materials are advised.\\nIntegrated into planning and building codes, these\\nmeasures aim to systematically reduce urban thermal\\nstress. Chapter 4 underscores continued collaboration\\nthrough the Heat Action Network and highlights Tamil\\nNadu State Land Use Research Board initiatives for\\nclimate resilience and sustainable urban development.',\n",

HEAT HAZARD & URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT  \\n– NEED FOR MITIGATION  \\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‟s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) \\nhighlights the rising risks of severe heat stress, compounded by drought, water scarcity, forest \\nfires, and tropical cyclones. These conditions are expected to lead to a 1,540% increase in \\nhealth-related deaths among people over 65 by 2090, with India projected to face an additional \\n1 million heat-related deaths if warming continues unchecked. Additionally, the international \\nLabour Organization (ILO) estimates that India lost 4.3% of working hours to heat stress in 1995, \\na figure expected to rise to 5.8% by 2030, equivalent to the loss of 34 million jobs. Intensifying \\nheat from climate change poses significant threats to health, food security, water availability, \\nand economic productivity. The 2024 report titled „Countdown on Health and Climate Change‟ \\npublished by The Lancet, has found increasing health risks from climate change in most \\ncountries, with India being one of the most impacted. Further, the report notes that 10 of the 15 \\nindicators it uses for monitoring climate change-related health hazards globally have reached \\n“concerning new records”. It also reports that in India, besides the risk of heat-related \\ndiseases, the report has flagged potential health impacts from rising instances of flooding, \\nincreasing vulnerability from infectious diseases, and high levels of air pollution, all of which \\nare getting exacerbated due to climate change. But the biggest risk, according to the report, is \\nfrom heat because of which about 181 billion potential labour hours were lost last year, an \\nincrease of 50% from the 1990-1999 annual average. \\nWith respect to health, heat is becoming an escalating concern across India, with significant \\nmortality from heat waves since the 2010s. From 2011 to 2018, 6,187 heat-related deaths were \\nreported, likely an undercount (CDKN, 2021). India began addressing heat as a disaster \\nmanagement issue in 2015, guiding states, districts, and local bodies to ensure preparedness \\nand response. Collaborative efforts by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), National \\nDisaster Management Authority (NDMA), and regional bodies have led to Heat Action Plans \\n(HAPs) in 23 states, including Tamil Nadu. These plans provide frameworks for preventive \\nmeasures, emergency aid, and treatment protocols, supported by five-day temperature \\nforecasts. \\nHowever, significant gaps exist in HAPs, as noted in multiple studies. Key issues include the \\nlack of localized, context-specific measures for heat mitigation, limited community \\ninvolvement, insufficient targeting of vulnerable groups, and inadequate financing for effective \\nimplementation. Additionally, HAPs have weak legal backing and address sectoral needs in \\nisolation, limiting their effectiveness in managing the complex, interconnected impacts of heat \\nstress on health, ecosystems, and productivity. Prolonged heat exacerbates food insecurity \\nand heightens human-animal conflicts, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations \\n(Centre for Policy Research, 2023). \\nTamil Nadu, located in southern India, experiences a tropical climate that makes it highly \\nsusceptible to heat stress. Despite being bordered by the sea and the Western Ghats, the state \\nregularly endures temperatures over 40°C for significant portions of the year. Studies predict',\n",

The causes of this heat retention are complex: urban \\ndensity, loss of vegetative cover, and the thermal properties of building materials collectively \\ncontribute to a warmer urban microclimate. The UHI effect leads to elevated temperatures that \\nparticularly impact low-income and vulnerable populations who often lack sufficient access to \\ncooling resources, exacerbating health and environmental inequalities.  \\nThe UHI effect, commonly referred to as the “heat island effect,” arises because urban areas \\nare generally warmer than surrounding rural landscapes. This temperature difference is largely \\ndue to the transformation of natural ground cover into built surfaces such as asphalt, concrete, \\nand buildings. These surfaces have lower albedo, or reflectivity, and thus absorb and retain \\nmore solar energy, reducing the natural shade and cooling effects typically provided by \\nvegetation. Additionally, urban areas with limited greenery have lower rates of \\nevapotranspiration, which would otherwise dissipate heat. The thermal properties of urban \\nmaterials, particularly their solar reflectance, thermal emissivity, and heat capacity, are \\nfundamental to the UHI effect as they determine how much sunlight is absorbed, emitted, or \\nretained within the city environment. \\n \\nFigure 2: Urban Heat Trap (Source: AQI) \\nThe consequences of UHIs extend beyond mere temperature increases; they impact \\ncommunities by raising summertime peak energy demand, escalating air conditioning costs, \\nincreasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and heightening health risks such as \\nheat-related illnesses and mortality. UHI also affects water quality as elevated temperatures',\n",

The IPCC (Climate Change 2022 - Impacts, \\nAdaptation, and Vulnerability) describes UHI as \"the relative warmth of a city compared with \\nsurrounding rural areas,\" a difference that results from urban land use, built environment \\nconfigurations, such as street layouts and building sizes, and the heat absorbing properties of \\nurban materials. Limited ventilation, reduced green spaces, and heat generated directly from \\nhuman activities, such as industrial and domestic sources, further contribute to this relative \\nwarmth. \\nWeather conditions and local meteorology, which include unique urban climates, significantly \\ninfluence energy use patterns at the regional and local levels. UHI, a central feature of urban \\nclimates, has direct implications for energy consumption. During periods of high UHI intensity, \\nair temperatures within a city can be several degrees higher than in surrounding rural areas, \\nleading to a surge in peak electricity demand for cooling during summer months. Studies, such \\nas those by Haider Taha (\"Heat Islands and Energy\"), indicate that peak electric demand in \\nurban areas may increase by up to 10% due to the UHI effect. \\nUHI intensity is usually measured by comparing urban temperatures with those in nearby rural \\nareas. However, temperatures can also vary within a city itself, leading to \"intra-urban heat \\nislands\". Intra-urban heat islands arise from the uneven distribution of heat-absorbing \\nmaterials, such as buildings and pavements, juxtaposed with cooler areas that feature trees, \\nwater bodies, or parks. Diagrams illustrating the UHI effect show that urban parks, ponds, and \\nresidential areas are often cooler than more densely built downtown zones, where concrete \\nand asphalt dominate. \\nIn understanding UHIs, it is essential to distinguish between surface heat islands and \\natmospheric heat islands. These differ in their formation mechanisms, measurement \\ntechniques, and impacts, as well as in cooling strategies: \\n\\uf0b7 Surface Heat Islands: This occurs due to the heat-absorbing properties of urban surfaces \\nsuch as roads and rooftops, which absorb and emit heat more than natural landscapes. \\nDuring warm days, urban surface temperatures can far exceed air temperatures, \\nsometimes by as much as 60°F. Surface heat islands are typically most intense during \\ndaylight hours, as materials like asphalt and roofing absorb significant solar radiation. \\n\\uf0b7 Atmospheric Heat Islands: These occur when the air over urban areas is warmer than the \\nair over adjacent rural zones. Atmospheric heat islands are generally less intense than \\nsurface heat islands and exhibit smaller temperature variations. They are most noticeable \\nat night when the stored heat from urban surfaces slowly releases into the atmosphere, \\nkeeping urban air temperatures elevated. \\nThis scientific distinction between surface and atmospheric heat islands provides insight into \\nhow the UHI effect operates across different urban contexts, affecting energy demand, air \\nquality, and public health. Addressing UHI requires tailored strategies that consider the distinct \\ncharacteristics of surface and atmospheric heat islands, as well as the unique urban fabrics of \\ncities like Chennai, Coimbatore, and Madurai, to create sustainable and resilient urban \\nenvironments.',\n",

Features like tall \\nbuildings trap heat and slow night-time cooling. UHI \\nintensity varies with location and weather patterns, \\naffecting temperatures on a local scale and diminishing \\nwith distance from urban centres. UHIs are examples of \\nlocalized climate change, limited in reach and primarily \\nimpacting city environments. \\nClimate Change: Climate change describes any \\nsignificant and long-lasting alteration in temperature, \\nprecipitation, wind, or other climate factors, spanning \\ndecades or longer. Climate change can result from \\nnatural processes (like solar radiation changes or ocean \\ncurrents) or human activities (such as deforestation or \\nfossil fuel burning), affecting the atmosphere‟s \\ncomposition and Earth‟s temperature over large regions \\nor globally. While often used interchangeably with global \\nwarming, climate change encompasses broader \\nphenomena, including changes in precipitation patterns, \\nextreme weather, and sea level rise. \\nGlobal Warming: Global warming refers specifically to \\nthe average increase in Earth's surface temperature, \\nprimarily due to greenhouse gas emissions from human \\nactivities. This warming amplifies global climate change \\nby altering climate patterns worldwide, increasing sea \\nlevels, and intensifying extreme weather events. Global \\nwarming is a component of climate change and is \\ntypically associated with the broader shifts that impact \\nglobal ecosystems, agricultural cycles, and human \\nhealth. \\nWhile urban heat islands are localized and mainly affect \\ncity temperatures, climate change and global warming \\noperate on a global scale, driven by systemic changes in \\nthe climate.

For every 1°F (0.6°C) rise in temperature, urban electric demand can \\nincrease by 1.5 to 2 percent, meaning that up to 10 percent of a city‟s electricity usage can be \\nattributed to the UHI effect. During extreme heat events, these increased demands may \\noverwhelm the system, potentially leading to rolling blackouts or power outages. \\nAIR QUALITY AND GREE NHOUSE GASES  \\nThe elevated temperatures from UHIs contribute to increased energy demand, which often \\nleads to higher emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases, particularly from fossil fuel \\npower plants. Pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter degrade \\nair quality, while greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to climate change. \\nAdditionally, elevated temperatures accelerate ground-level ozone formation, as nitrogen \\noxides and volatile organic compounds react more quickly in sunlight, further degrading air \\nquality. \\nHUMAN HEALTH AND COM FORT  \\nUHIs can negatively impact human health by increasing daytime temperatures, reducing \\nnight-time cooling, and elevating air pollution levels.

From 1989 to 2018, annual rainfall \\naveraged 898 mm, with nearly half provided by the Northeast monsoon. As temperatures rise, \\nthe State is increasingly vulnerable to heat waves that threaten ecosystems and the health of its \\npopulation. \\nTEMPERATURE TRENDS  \\nAnalysis of Tamil Nadu‟s climate data reveals significant warming trends.

Vulnerability varies widely depending on individual and community \\ncontexts, with complex social, environmental, and political factors amplifying their \\nsusceptibility to heat stress. \\nCHALLENGES IN RECORDING HEAT IMPACTS  \\nHeat-related deaths and illnesses are significantly underreported across India due to limited \\nprotocols and awareness around heat hazards. Institutions such as the India Meteorological \\nDepartment (IMD) and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) recommend that state-\\nlevel committees monitor and report heat-related casualties accurately. Guidelines suggest \\nthat each district records maximum temperatures, conducts autopsies when needed, and \\nprovides evidence for deaths attributed to heat exposure. Yet, reporting remains inconsistent, \\nwith only about 10% of total heat-related deaths officially documented. This discrepancy arises \\ndue to inadequate awareness among healthcare professionals and gaps in resources across \\nhealth institutions, especially in rural areas. Moreover, heat is not yet classified as a disaster \\nunder India‟s National Disaster Management Act of 2005, limiting funds for heat mitigation to a \\nfraction of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Without an official classification, the \\nstate‟s heat preparedness relies on local actions without comprehensive federal support for \\nheat-related interventions. \\na. Built Environment and Ecological Systems \\nBuildings not designed for extreme heat, lacking proper ventilation, insulation, and cooling \\nsystems, contribute to indoor heat stress, affecting the well-being and productivity of \\noccupants.

Children, seniors, pregnant \\nwomen, persons with disabilities, outdoor workers, and migrant labourers are especially \\nvulnerable. Excessive heat exposure impacts not only human health and productivity but also \\naffects ecological and economic systems, which can contribute to shifting climate patterns. \\nCurrent Heat Action Plans in India emphasize response and recovery, with limited focus on \\nlong-term heat mitigation. Acknowledging these gaps, the Tamil Nadu State Planning \\nCommission, with support from the British High Commission, has developed a strategy that \\nprioritizes a multidisciplinary approach to heat mitigation. This strategy seeks to address the \\nurgent need for heat resilience, especially in developing regions with limited resources. The \\nHMS focus is on three goals:  \\n1. Improving human well-being,  \\n2. Protecting ecosystems, and  \\n3. Tackling climate change.  \\nBy fostering interdepartmental collaboration, aligning policies, and identifying areas of \\nconvergence, the HMS provides a structured approach to mitigate extreme heat effects, thus \\nsafeguarding public health, food security, and sustainable development in Tamil Nadu. \\nThe development of Tamil Nadu Heat Mitigation Strategy (TN HMS) involved extensive \\nconsultations with experts in meteorology, ecology, disaster risk management, data analytics, \\nand urban planning, among others. This collaborative effort brought together scientific and \\nlocal insights, addressing social, cultural, and economic factors specific to Tamil Nadu. The \\nreport provides baseline data on heat stress indicators and spatial and temporal variations in \\nheat exposure, supporting the State‟s ongoing efforts to build heat resilience and guide policy \\nplanning and implementation. Recommendations within the strategy are categorized into short-\\nterm and long-term actions, organized across three action pathways outlined below. Chapter 4 \\ndetails the recommendations under each of these pathways.  \\nHEALTH AND WELLBEING  \\nThis area addresses the physical, mental, and social health of human populations, along with \\nthe ecological health of animals, marine life, and plants.

The goal is to balance resource \\nconsumption with conservation efforts, fostering long-term ecological and economic stability \\namid increasing heat stress and climate change. \\nCOOL ING SOLUTIONS  \\nCooling solutions encompass strategies and technologies designed to minimize heat exposure \\nfor individuals, built environments, and ecosystems. This includes systemic design, \\ndevelopment, and urban planning measures alongside innovative technologies to enhance \\nthermal comfort and reduce the impact of heat stress on all. \\nThe report emphasizes integrating these measures at scale to minimize heat impacts \\nState-wide, supported by a cross-functional, inclusive approach to build sustainable heat \\nresilience for Tamil Nadu. The goal of the heat mitigation strategy document is to outline \\nmeasures and mechanisms to reduce heat stress and safeguard ecosystem health. This \\nstrategy, informed by multi-sectoral assessments and insights from consultations, aims to \\nimprove the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups while ensuring their productivity despite \\nrising temperatures.  \\nThe strategy promotes comprehensive, scalable recommendations across three action \\npathways listed above. Integrating these areas allows for policy coherence, enabling \\ninterventions with multiplier effects and co-benefits.

By focusing on equitable access to resources, the strategy seeks to foster \\na healthier, more resilient, and stable environment for all residents, setting the foundation for a \\nsustainable future in a warming climate. The three action pathways highlighted in the HMS gets \\njustified with the findings of the recently published Lancet report on Health and Climate Change \\nin October 2024. The report reveals the escalating human impact of climate change, \\nparticularly from rising temperatures. Between 2019 and 2023, people worldwide faced an \\naverage of 46 extra days of health-threatening heat, reaching 50 additional days in 2023, with 31 \\ncountries experiencing at least 100 more heat-dangerous days than expected without climate \\nchange.

India, especially, \\nexperienced record-breaking heatwaves, with each person exposed to over 2,400 hours \\n(approximately 100 days) of moderate heat stress, making even light outdoor activities risky. \\nThe report further highlights the widespread disruption of sleep, with high temperatures leading \\nto a 6% increase in sleep loss compared to 1986-2005 levels, which affects both mental and \\nphysical health. Climate impacts also extended to food security, as by 2022, 151 million people \\nacross 124 countries faced moderate to severe food shortages from heatwaves, droughts, and \\nextreme weather. Vulnerable groups, like infants and the elderly, were severely affected, with \\neach exposed to 7.7 and 8.4 heatwave days per year, respectively, from 2014-2023, marking \\nsignificant increases over previous decades.

CEPT University conducted this assessment with the aim to \\nprovide State-level heat mitigation recommendations by developing a state-level heat map, \\ndividing the state into heat zones at the district level, and identifying hotspots for the State \\nGovernment's comprehension and for integration into future land use planning. The \\nmethodology outlines an assessment of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) trends across the \\nstate of daytime and night-time, at the state and district level of Tamil Nadu for the past two \\ndecades (2003-2023). Additionally, the district-level heat zones and UHI intensity were \\ndetermined to comprehend the impact of climate change and urbanization on the temperature \\npatterns. \\nSpatio-temporal analysis reveals that Tamil Nadu has witnessed notable changes in Land \\nSurface Temperature (LST) across different seasons from 2003 to 2023. There has been a \\nconsistent increase in night-time LST, particularly in summer with a substantial increase in \\nareas by 59% with a night-time LST between 24-26°C over the years. In contrast, there was a \\nsignificant drop of areas experiencing intense heat, with a daytime LST between 46-50°C by \\n28.2% of the total state. Urban areas, under clear, calm sky conditions gradually release \\naccumulated heat at night, causing the surface and ambient temperatures to rise. This increase \\noften persists without cooling down significantly until the following day. Therefore, to verify \\nseasonal night-time LST changes, night-time LST maps were derived. These night-time LST \\ndifference maps show how Urban Heat Island effects have increased across different seasons \\nproviding insights of how night-time LST has increased in different parts of the Tamil Nadu state \\nwith mean LST increasing by 1.5 °C across smart cities, emphasizing the need for targeted \\nmitigation strategies against UHI effects. \\nTo identify the hottest districts of Tamil Nadu over the two decades daytime and night-time \\nmean LST data for four time periods were taken (2001-2003, 2011-2013, 2017-2020 and 2021-\\n2023). To mitigate anomalies in an individual year data, average of three-year periods was \\ncomputed providing a more stable representation of LST trends over time period. As per \\nanalysis, Thoothukkudi emerges as a district consistently experiencing maximum daytime mean \\nLST reaching above 42°C in various periods, while Chennai experiences the highest night-time \\nchange in LST over the analysed period. Chennai’s average night-time LST increased by 1.5°C \\nfrom 23°C in 2001-2003 to 24.5°C in 2021-2023. \\nTo analyse the behaviour of all districts across Tamil Nadu when hottest and coldest day and \\nnight were observed in the year 2023 air temperature data was collected from 61 weather \\nstations across Tamil Nadu and identification of the hottest and coldest days and nights was \\ndone. Based on those dates, four months mean LST data was taken for all districts to see their \\ntemperatures on those days. During the hottest day in June, several districts recorded LST \\nbetween 42°C to 44°C, indicating widespread heat across the state. Conversely, on the coldest \\nday in December, certain districts, such as Chennai, Karur, and the central part of Tamil Nadu, \\nstill maintained relatively warm LST above 30°C.

Episodic occurrences of \\nextremely high surface air temperatures spanning multiple days across the Indian subcontinent \\nhave been on the rise during the last five decades (Rohini et al., 2016). Also, while both the \\ndaytime and night-time temperature extremes have been increasing, the warm spells in night-\\ntime temperatures have surged more rapidly than daytime temperatures (Mishra et al., 2017). \\nIndia has become a hotspot for heat-related mortality. An increasing toll of deaths due to heat \\nwaves recorded a spur in recent decades from a cumulative of 5,330 deaths reported during \\n1978–1999 to extreme cases of 3,054 and 2,248 deaths in 2003 and 2015, respectively \\n(Chaudhury et al., 2000; Ratnam et al., 2016). Heat-wave-related mass mortality events in India \\nare expected to increase from 46 to 82%, with the shift in the mean number of heat-wave days \\nfrom 6 to 8 (Mazdiyasni et al., 2017). \\nThe climatic conditions in Tamil Nadu, situated in south-eastern India, have gradually shifted, \\ntransforming the state from a dry sub-humid region to a semi-arid one in recent years. (Raju et \\nal., 2013). Particular findings indicate that by the end of the century, there may be an increase \\nof 3.30 °C during the day and 3.55 °C during the night, and there would be a 3.24% drop in \\nrainfall (TNGCC, 2022). People who live in these areas are negatively impacted by the severe \\ntemperatures and atmospheric conditions that follow since they can lead to physiological \\nstress and occasionally even death (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Government of \\nIndia), 2022). \\nHence, documenting the current state of Tamil Nadu is imperative.

Understanding these patterns are important for adapting \\nmitigation strategies against extreme heat events, enhancing the region‟s resilience to the \\nclimate impacts. \\n2.2. 2 TRENDS OF NIGHT-TIME LST CHANGE OVER THE YEARS (2003 & 2023) \\nWhen observing LST trends, it is observed that the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) is most \\ncritical during night-time. Thus, night-time LST has been considered for identifying the trends \\nfrom the year 2003-2023. \\nThe spatio-temporal changes in mean night-time LST for four seasons (summer, monsoon, \\npost-monsoon, and winter) in a given year have been computed between 2003 and 2023. Mean \\nNight-time LST data for two years 2003 and 2023 were acquired for all four seasons, allowing for \\na comparison of LST trends over two decades. The difference in LST between the two years was \\ncalculated by subtracting the 2003 LST from the LST of 2023, identifying changes in night-time \\nLST patterns over the time span. \\nThe difference map has been divided into colour gradient ranging from blue colour (denoting a \\ndecrease in night-time LST) to red colour (denoting an increase in LST), with yellow colour \\nrepresenting no significant change. Smart cities were considered for the analysis due to dense \\nurban population. \\nDuring summer season, significant rise in night-time LST (please refer to Figure-23 )was \\nobserved predominantly around metropolitan areas of the Tamil Nadu state. Specifically, there \\nwas an increase of about 3°C in LST for cities such as Chennai and Vellore, around 2°C for \\nThoothukkudi, Madurai, and Tiruchirappalli, and about 1.5°C rise for Tirunelveli.   \\nDuring Monsoon season, notable increase in night-time LST was observed. Specifically, an \\nincrease of approximate 4°C in night-time LST for cities such as Chennai, Vellore, and \\nTiruchirappalli. Moreover, cities such as Tiruppur and Coimbatore experienced an increase of \\nabout 3°C, while Madurai and Thoothukkudi saw an increase of about 2°C between the years \\n2003 and 2023 (refer to Figure-23).',\n",

Tamil Nadu State Land \\nUse Research Board with the support of UNEP commissioned studies to identify vulnerable \\nhotspots of the Urban Heat Island in the major cities of Tamil Nadu. This study aimed to conduct \\na Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) analysis, with the primary objective of mapping current \\nhotspots across Tamil Nadu based on four land classifications: (1) Built-up, (2) Vegetation \\nCover, (3) Water Bodies, and (4) Barren Land. This analysis supports the development of an \\neffective UHIE mitigation plan. The study focused on identifying and assessing hotspots across \\nurban areas of Tamil Nadu and provided recommendations for managing UHIE mitigation in \\ndesignated smart cities. To meet the study’s objectives, the following actions were emphasized: \\n\\uf0b7 Identification of Urban Hotspots: Hotspots were identified through a systematic \\nreview of existing literature and pilot projects, utilizing sources such as the 'Literature \\nReview and Assessment Report of UHIE in CMA' (authored by CARBSE, CRDF, and CEPT \\nUniversity with UNEP support). \\n\\uf0b7 Mapping of Spatio-Temporal SUHI Variability: The spatial and temporal variability of \\nthe SUHI effect was mapped with a comprehensive assessment of Land Use And Land \\nCover (LULC) dynamics and other urban planning indicators to validate the identified \\nhotspots. \\n\\uf0b7 Focused Analysis on Designated Smart Cities: Initially, the study concentrated on 11 \\ndesignated smart cities in Tamil Nadu, with two emerging cities selected for further \\nanalysis in consultation with experts. \\n\\uf0b7 Graded Temporal Analysis of Landscape Indices: A temporal analysis from 2013 to \\n2023 was conducted using landscape indices—NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation \\nIndex), NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index), and MNDWI (Modified Normalized \\nDifference Water Index)—to assess the impact of urbanization and changes in blue-\\ngreen cover, correlating these trends with UHIE in selected smart cities. \\n\\uf0b7 Targeted Recommendations for UHIE Mitigation: Recommendations for UHIE \\nmitigation were provided based on an evaluation of the urban characteristics of each \\nhotspot across the two selected cities. \\nThe methodology assessed Land Surface Temperature (LST) across 11 smart cities: Chennai, \\nCoimbatore, Madurai, Salem, Thanjavur, Vellore, Thoothukkudi, Tirunelveli, Tiruppur, \\nTiruchirappalli, and Erode. Analysis of daytime and night-time LST variations indicated a linear \\ntemperature increase over two decades, correlating with LULC changes. The UHI effect, \\nparticularly the change in night-time temperature, holds significant implications. Urban areas \\nrelease accumulated heat slowly overnight, raising surface and ambient temperatures until the \\nfollowing day. Between 2013 and 2023, summer night-time temperatures increased in \\nThoothukkudi (0.68°C), Chennai (0.63°C), Madurai (0.36°C), and Thanjavur (0.16°C). Despite an\",\n",

In Madurai, 43% and 27% of surface areas currently fall under the 36-40°C and 41-45°C \\nranges, with areas exceeding 45°C reduced by 17% since 2013, while those in the 36-40°C and \\n41-45°C ranges increased by 18% and 5%, respectively. In Salem, 43% of the area remains \\nwithin the critical 41-45°C range, with a 34% and 23% increase in the 36-40°C range since 2013. \\nThoothukkudi’s temperature distribution shows moderate (31-35°C), high (36-40°C), and critical \\n(41-45°C) ranges at 19%, 22%, and 24%, with a 28% decrease in areas above 45°C but a 14% \\nand 3% increase in the 36-40°C and 41-45°C ranges. Chennai, experiencing rapid urban \\nexpansion, has seen a 42% decrease in the critical temperature range (41-45°C and above) \\nsince 2003, with 64% of its area now mapped at 36-40°C. \\nMadurai and Thoothukkudi were chosen for detailed assessment based on population density, \\ncoastal proximity, night-time mean LST, summer LST changes, and LULC changes. Madurai, a \\ndensely populated centre, contrasts with coastal Thoothukkudi, providing a varied scope for the \\nstudy. In Madurai, correlations between spectral indices and LST showed a weak, negative \\nlinear correlation between mean LST and NDVI, with Pearson correlation coefficients of R2013 = \\n-0.155 and R2023 = -0.331, both at a 95% confidence interval. Areas with vegetation cover in \\n2013 displayed low NDVI values (0.1 to 0.25), and higher mean LST values (35 ± 4°C) were \\nobserved in 2023 with NDVI values rising to 0.45 to 0.6. NDBI showed a weak to moderate \\npositive correlation with mean LST, with R2013 = 0.132 and R2023 = 0.508, suggesting a link \\nbetween built-up cover and increased surface temperatures. \\nIn Thoothukkudi, correlations indicated a weak, negative linear relationship between LST and \\nNDVI (R2013 = -0.192; R2023 = -0.134) and a strong, positive correlation between NDBI and LST \\n(R2013 = 0.697; R2023 = 0.635). This relationship suggests urban expansion has led to higher \\ntemperatures, with NDBI values indicating significant built-up cover and associated heat \\nretention. Further LULC classification showed that from 2013 to 2023, Madurai lost 57 km² of \\nvegetation and added 8% to built-up areas, while 4% converted to barren land. Thoothukkudi \\nexperienced a 12 km² increase in built-up area and a 7 km² decrease in open spaces. \\nHotspots identified in Madurai primarily span residential, institutional, commercial, and \\nindustrial zones characterized by dense, low to medium-rise buildings, low vegetation cover, \\nhigh impervious surfaces, and limited natural heat sinks. Thoothukkudi’s hotspots are \\ndistributed in public, institutional, and industrial areas. Recommendations are provided for city \\nlevel urban heat mitigation measures in the Chapter 4.',\n",

Therefore, the present study to identify the hotspots across the Tamil \\nNadu state, will strengthen the scientific evidence for the developing the mitigation and \\nadaptation measures through town planning schemes or local area development plan. It will \\nalso enable the government and the other stakeholders to take necessary action against the \\nvulnerability of UHIE.  \\nLITERATURE REVIEW  \\nThe objective of the present study has been complied with by conducting a systematic \\nliterature review of the academic studies and pilot studies, from 2008 to 2022, to comprehend \\nthe spatio-temporal variance of UHIE over the years, the dynamics of UHIE with the urban \\nindicators, and to identify the hotspots. \\nIn Coimbatore, a study (Jayabharathi & Kottiswaran, 2015) found that the maximum and \\nminimum temperature anomalies in Coimbatore had an annual increase of 0.04oC and 0.1oC, \\nrespectively. Critical temperature anomalies in Coimbatore and annual mean-maximum and \\nminimum temperatures in Sulur and Kinattukkadavu have been attributed to the urbanization \\ntrend. Between 1995 to 2015, in Coimbatore, the built-up area increased by 11.17%, while the \\ngrowth rate between 2005 to 2015 was significantly 50.04% (Saravanan et al., 2018). \\nConsequently, the vegetation cover and water body have reduced by 14.55% and 2%, \\nrespectively. The mean land-surface temperature was observed an overall increase of 3.8oC \\nbetween 2005 to 2015. Moreover, a significant increase of 1.2oC, 1.3oC, and 1.4oC was observed \\nin dense built-up, industrial, and wastelands, respectively, during the studied period. \\nIn Kancheepuram district, the spatial-temporal intensity of the Surface Urban Heat Island \\n(SUHI) was mapped highest in urban and barren land. The vegetation resulted in cool sinks, \\nwhere the industrial areas and paved, unshaded parking lots were identified as hotspots with \\nthe highest SUHI intensity. The LST range was observed as 25oC to 39oC in 2005, saw a \\nsignificant change in 2021, and mapped as 31oC to 47oC (Raj et al., 2023). In the last four \\ndecades (1985-2021), the built-up area has increased by 20% and the mean Land Surface \\nTemperature has increased by 152 %. The study also embarked on the transformation of land \\nuse and the thermo-physical properties of surface materials as the most critical factors of UHI.\",\n",

The presence of the industrial belt of BHEL and the associated township (BHEL \\nNagar) in the southeast part of the district contributes largely to higher UHI. According to a \\nrecent study (Badugu et al., 2023), the trend analysis also showed that the mean annual LST is \\nrising at a rate of 0.166K per decade between 2001 to 2021. The maximum UHI intensity was \\nmapped as 4.5 K and 4.16 K in the summer and winter for the past two decades. Night-time UHI \\nis predominant, as the night-time maximum UHI intensity for summer mapped 5.26 K as the \\nhighest and 0.534 K as the average during summer. \\nDistrict Collector office, Tiruchirappalli Railway station, Periyar Nagar, Cantonment post office, \\nDistrict Court, Periyar College of Pharmaceuticals, Sundaram Hospital, St. Joseph College, \\nAirport, Shri-Raja-Rajeswari Temple area, Oxford Engineering College, and The Wireless \\nStation, were mapped as critical hotspots. Moreover, Shri Boolaganatha Swami Temple, \\nThirumangalam, and Arulmiga Madhura Kaliyamman temple area were identified as heat sinks. \\nIn Tiruppur, between 2001 and 2018, the built-up cover has increased from 21.74 sqkm to \\n119.02 sqkm, while the vegetation cover has reduced from 1442.3 sq. km to 1328 sq. km \\n(Ramasamy & K., 2020). A steady increase in LST was observed during the studied period, and \\nthe estimated LST ranged between 19.32oC to 31.75 oC, where the urban built areas showed \\nhigher concentrations, but in the high-density settlements with narrow streets and taller \\nbuildings, the LST was low, however, the study mentioned that this might significantly impact \\nthe night-time UHI with higher ambient temperature. The study also embarked on the need to \\navoid the conversion of vegetation cover and the inclusion of appropriate urban geometry in the \\nbylaws and urban development guidelines. \\nSeveral studies (Aarthi & Gnanappazham, 2019; Lakshmi & Thomas, 2018; Amirtham et al., \\n2009) (Shenbagaraj et al., 2019)  have been conducted in Chennai, where Land Use Land Cover \\nchanges and Urban sprawl have been mapped through remote sensing data from 1991 to 2017, \\nshowing- a radial trend of urbanization along the major transit corridors.

RECOMMENDATION S FOR UHIE MITIGATION   \\n     AND ADAPTATION  \\nThis chapter presents strategic recommendations to mitigate the Urban Heat Island Effect \\n(UHIE) in Tamil Nadu through interventions at the state, city, and building levels. Given Tamil \\nNadu‟s hot and humid climate, especially in densely urbanized areas like Chennai, Madurai, \\nand Coimbatore, a comprehensive approach combining surface-level UHIE assessments \\nwith microclimate evaluations is essential. These combined assessments will equip urban \\nplanners and policymakers with data-driven insights to make sustainable, long-term \\ndecisions, particularly as rising temperatures and climate change intensify urban heat \\nchallenges.  The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is already \\nincorporating such measures into the Chennai Master Plan 2026. Similar approaches are \\nrecommended for regional, master, and local area plans across the State, focusing on \\nbuilding resilient and adaptive urban systems. \\nUnder the Tamil Nadu Heat Mitigation Strategy (TN HMS), these recommendations target not \\nonly human needs but also the broader ecosystem, addressing the effects of extreme heat \\non plants, animals, and natural resources. This chapter includes guidance for mitigating \\nhealth impacts related to excessive heat and provides solutions focused on cooling and \\nsustained productivity for both urban and rural areas. \\nThe strategy document is designed to extend beyond the initial project phase, guiding \\nindividual departments on actionable steps for lasting impact. Local heat resilience projects \\noften fail due to gaps in integration, finance, and strategic planning—factors critical to \\nensuring long-term project viability. By offering a pathway to move key recommendations to \\nthe Detailed Project Report (DPR) stage, the strategy document supports in identifying areas \\nfor pilot implementation and potential state-wide rollout. It highlights existing policies and \\nschemes that departments can leverage to enhance heat resilience. The TNSPC and \\nTNSDMA will function as knowledge hubs for advancing heat mitigation by offering technical \\nsupport, capacity-building, and assistance in project management, regulatory compliance, \\nfinancing, and stakeholder engagement. They will also provide guidance on gender, social \\nequity, and inclusion considerations across departments. \\n \\n4.1 STATE LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS  \\nThe Heat Mitigation Strategy identifies six leading agencies as anchors for immediate heat \\nmitigation efforts across key sectors (refer to Table 2 for details on agency roles) at the State \\nLevel. To foster systemic climate-proofing in Tamil Nadu, this document directs stakeholders \\ntoward prioritizing actionable, resilient strategies. Drawing on case studies and identifying \\npractical opportunities, it outlines pathways for sustainable development and climate \\nresilience, strengthening the foundation for protecting people, nature, and infrastructure in a \\nwarming climate. The guiding principles to deliberate further on state level action plan for \\nurban heat mitigation is also provided in this section following Table 2.',\n",

This section outlines actionable recommendations in the areas of \\nimplementation, planning, governance, and community engagement to build resilient cities \\nthat mitigate heat impacts effectively. Several initiatives, case studies, and policies unique to \\nTamil Nadu illustrate the importance of targeted interventions that prioritize ecosystem \\nhealth and community well-being. \\n1. Implementation and Preparedness \\n\\uf0b7 Ecological Preservation and Green Spaces \\nProtecting and restoring green areas is essential for both rural and urban heat mitigation. \\nIn rural areas, intact ecosystems like forests and wetlands serve as natural buffers \\nagainst extreme heat and drought, supporting community resilience. Urban \\nenvironments benefit from green zones such as parks and groves, which lower surface \\ntemperatures, provide shaded areas, and improve air quality. A noteworthy example is \\nGuindy National Park in Chennai, which helps modulate urban temperatures while \\nproviding ecological, recreational, and health benefits to the city. \\n\\uf0b7 Tree Planting Initiatives \\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Green Tamil Nadu Mission aims to expand tree cover from 23.8% to \\n33% by 2030-2031. This program involves planting 265 million trees over 13,500 sq. km, \\nprioritizing native and climate-resilient species. This initiative supports urban and rural \\ngreening efforts, with trees planted in urban public spaces, institutional lands, and \\ntemple premises. Additionally, the Kurunthoppu Thittam project promotes the \\nestablishment of native groves at schools and public institutions to enhance urban green \\ncover and mitigate urban heat. \\n\\uf0b7 Water Resource Protection and Urban Cooling \\nIn urban areas, protecting water bodies and infrastructure, such as lakes and wetlands, \\nis critical for alleviating heat. Urban water management practices can create natural \\ncooling effects, with bodies like Cooum River and Pallikaranai Wetland in Chennai acting \\nas heat sinks. Restoring and safeguarding these areas not only mitigates urban heat but \\nalso addresses water scarcity and flood risks in the city. \\n\\uf0b7 Innovative Cooling Infrastructure \\nTamil Nadu has shown promise in adopting innovative cooling infrastructure. For \\nexample, refrigerated storage facilities and cold-chain logistics are being expanded \\nunder the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Produce Marketing Board to improve food \\nresilience during extreme heat.

Key areas \\nof intervention include expanding green cover, improving surface materials, restoring natural \\nheat sinks, and promoting sustainable transportation systems. These initiatives align with Tamil \\nNadu‟s broader climate action goals and support the unique environmental and socio-\\neconomic needs of the state. \\n4.2.1 INCREASE OF GRE EN COVER  \\nExpanding green cover across urban areas in Tamil Nadu can \\nsignificantly mitigate UHIE by providing shaded areas, cooling \\neffects through evapotranspiration, and improving air quality. \\nGiven Tamil Nadu‟s tropical climate, increasing urban greenery is \\ncritical to reducing ambient temperatures, especially during peak \\nsummer months. Integrating green spaces into urban planning \\nframeworks, such as City Master plans, Development Green \\nZones, and Greening in OSR lands, riverbanks etc, establishes a \\nstructured pathway for enhancing greenery in urban \\nenvironments across the state. \\nIn Tamil Nadu, green cover initiatives can focus on urban forestry, green transit corridors, and \\npocket parks within residential and commercial zones. Urban forestry, particularly in larger \\ncities, provides extensive shading, while green transit corridors with tree-lined walkways and \\nbike lanes help reduce heat exposure along busy routes. Smaller green spaces, such as pocket \\nparks and residential gardens, play a significant role in cooling densely populated \\nneighbourhoods. \\nTo maximize the cooling effect of green cover, native plant species should be prioritized, as they \\nare well-suited to Tamil Nadu‟s climate, with high tolerance to heat and varying rainfall \\npatterns. These species provide shade and cooling benefits with minimal maintenance, making \\nthem ideal for urban settings. Regular management and appropriate placement will ensure \\noptimal cooling from urban green cover and aid in stormwater management. \\nProjected Outcomes: \\n\\uf0b7 Temperature Reduction: Native green cover can lower ambient air temperatures \\nthrough shading and evapotranspiration. \\n\\uf0b7 Environmental Benefits: Increased greenery contributes to stormwater management, \\nimproves air quality, and enhances carbon sequestration, supporting public health and \\nresilience against climate change in Tamil Nadu. \\n4.2.2 CHANGE OF SURFA CE COVER  \\nReplacing traditional paved surfaces that absorb heat with materials designed to reflect or \\nretain less heat can effectively reduce surface and ambient temperatures across Tamil Nadu‟s',\n",

This approach is especially relevant in densely built areas, where conventional paving \\ncontributes significantly to the UHIE. \\nKey focus areas for Tamil Nadu‟s surface cover initiatives include using permeable (water-\\nretentive) surfaces with high void percentages, which help absorb rainwater, and adopting cool \\npavements with high Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) to reduce solar heat gain. These materials \\nnot only reduce surface temperatures but also help in managing stormwater, which is essential \\nfor flood-prone urban areas like Chennai during the monsoon season. \\nCool pavements include a range of materials and technologies designed to retain less heat and \\nmaintain lower surface temperatures compared to conventional pavements. In Tamil Nadu, \\nthese pavements can play a significant role in addressing urban heat islands, which arise partly \\ndue to the increased heat absorbed by paved surfaces in densely populated areas. \\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Smart Cities scheme provides an excellent opportunity to explore and \\nimplement cool pavements as a practical solution for urban cooling. By integrating cool \\npavement technologies in smart city plans, Tamil Nadu can address urban heat island effects \\nmore effectively, reducing surface temperatures in densely populated areas. This initiative can \\nalso enhance the resilience of urban infrastructure to heat while contributing to improved water \\nquality and overall urban comfort, aligning with the broader goals of the Smart Cities mission. \\nConventional pavements, typically made of asphalt and concrete, can reach peak surface \\ntemperatures of 48–67°C during summer. This heat is absorbed and transferred to subsurface \\nlayers, releasing warmth back into the atmosphere at night, which exacerbates night-time \\nurban heat. Additionally, these heated surfaces can warm stormwater runoff, which flows into \\nlocal water bodies, impacting water quality and local ecosystems. Adopting cool pavements \\ncan thus help mitigate these heat and water quality challenges, supporting Tamil Nadu‟s efforts \\nto improve urban climate resilience. \\nProjected Outcome: \\n\\uf0b7 Cooler Surfaces: By minimizing solar heat absorption \\nand re-radiation, permeable and cool pavements \\ncontribute to a cooler urban environment and mitigate \\nUHIE, particularly at night. \\n\\uf0b7 Improved Water Management: Permeable surfaces help \\nmanage stormwater more effectively, reducing urban \\nflooding risks during intense rainfall. \\n4.2.3 RESTORATION OF NATURAL HEAT SINKS  \\nRestoring natural heat sinks, such as water bodies and large green open spaces, provides \\nessential cooling benefits in Tamil Nadu‟s urban centres.

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  III \\nFOREWORD \\nIn November 2007, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux gave the Institut national \\nde santé publique du Québec a mandate to manage the health section of Initiative 21 of The \\nAction Plan on Climate Change. In the context of its deliberations, in 2009 the INSPQ published a \\nliterature review\\n focusing on measures to mitigate urban heat islands. It was produced mainly \\nfor the municipalities and non-profit organizations that work in the field to mitigate urban heat \\nislands and promote the preventive adaptation of programs and infrastructure to climate \\nchange. This literature review has become a reference to implement local preventive \\ndemonstration projects to deal with the phenomenon.  \\nGiven the proliferation over the past 10 years of new scientific studies devoted to measures to \\nmitigate urban heat islands, it seemed not only timely to update the information and references \\npresented in the review but also to review the overall data, especially those available for the \\nhottest years recorded in Québec, climate projections, the impact on morbidity and mortality of \\nurban heat islands, and so on. Moreover, numerous promising projects to mitigate urban heat \\nislands have been implemented since 2009, especially in the context of the Québec \\ngovernment’s climate change action plans.  \\nThis literature review cannot replace the recommendations of experts in fields such as \\narchitecture, urban planning, transportation, and engineering concerned by the fight against \\nurban heat islands. It affords a comprehensive view of existing measures and reports on certain \\nstudies that have tested their efficacy in terms of cooling. The literature review was submitted to \\n11 revisers, seven of them external, who are specialists in the fields of expertise that the control \\nmeasures listed cover. The necessary corrections were made in the wake of their comments. The \\nauthors assume sole responsibility for errors or omissions in the text.',\n",

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  1 \\nHIGHLIGHTS \\n• This literature review covers measures to mitigate urban heat islands that decision-makers \\nand public and private property managers, municipal stakeholders, non-profit organizations, \\nand other project designers can implement in Québec to ensure healthy, comfortable living \\nenvironments. \\n• Urban spread, the loss of crown cover, soil sealing, the use of heat-retaining materials, heat \\nand greenhouse gas emissions stemming from human activities, and urban morphology with \\ndense neighbourhoods and narrow streets are causal factors in urban heat islands. Rising \\ntemperatures and more frequent heat waves against a backdrop of climate change are likely \\nto exacerbate their impact. \\n• Urban heat islands can have detrimental environmental impacts such as the deterioration of \\nair quality and adversely affect human health and well-being. Certain factors for increased \\nvulnerability to heat such as age and chronic diseases warrant paying particular attention to \\ncertain populations when adaptation measures are implemented. Urban heat islands, which \\nare often situated in underprivileged neighbourhoods, are also contributing to social \\ninequalities in health. \\n• Permeable materials facilitate district cooling by fostering water infiltration in the soil and \\nevaporation, whereas high-albedo materials promote the cooling of cities by preventing the \\nabsorption of solar radiation. \\n• Greening measures engender high cooling gains in urban settings. When vegetation is used \\non the roofs or walls of buildings, it improves their insulation by keeping them cool in the \\nsummer and limiting heat loss in the winter. However, climate change is affecting plants \\n(heat, insects). It is, therefore, important to plant more trees but also to carefully choose them \\nto limit deleterious impacts on health and the risk of canopy loss stemming from different \\nmeteorological hazards.  \\n• Existing and new buildings must be adapted to climate change. Recourse to air conditioning \\nalone must not be considered to cool homes. Complementary solutions must be explored. \\nChallenges that urban heat poses are to be considered in building architecture, e.g., \\nbioclimatic architecture, and in urban planning, e.g., urban morphology. \\n• Blue spaces such as lakes and ponds can alternately act as a source of heat or cooling in \\nurban environments. Such spaces with large areas are usually more effective from the \\nstandpoint of cooling, as is circulating water in rivers or when technologies based on water \\nevaporation such as fountains are used. Reliance on green infrastructure in stormwater \\nmanagement engenders numerous benefits, including the mitigation of urban heat islands, \\nresilience to flooding, and improved water quality.',\n",

Climate change is \\nalready increasing the number of high-heat days, a trend that will continue in the coming years. \\nIt is, therefore, important to bolster the resilience to heat of cities and buildings for the benefit \\nof the health of the population. \\nContext \\nIn 2009, the Institut national de santé publique du Québec published an initial literature review \\ndevoted to measures to mitigate urban heat islands. It was intended mainly for on-site \\nresponders from non-profit organizations and the municipalities to support the fight against \\nurban heat islands and preventive adaptation to climate change in programs and infrastructure. \\nGiven the abundance of scientific literature concerning the efficacy of measures to mitigate \\nurban heat islands over the past 10 years, it is desirable to update the information. Moreover, \\ncase studies are documented to illustrate possible means of combating the phenomenon. \\nAlthough the review in no way replaces the opinions of experts in the fields of land-use \\nplanning, architecture, and engineering, it affords an overview of existing measures to mitigate \\nurban heat islands and reports certain studies that have tested their efficacy in terms of cooling \\ngains. \\nThey are listed according to four main categories, i.e., revegetation measures, measures related \\nto sustainable urban infrastructure, stormwater management and soil permeability measures, \\nand measures to reduce anthropogenic heat, caused by human beings. \\nTHE DEFINITION OF URBAN HEAT ISLANDS \\nThe expression “urban heat islands” means the temperature difference \\nobserved between urban environments and surrounding rural areas, or \\nbetween the areas in an intra-urban perimeter. Air temperatures in urban \\ncentres can be as much as 12°C higher than in adjoining regions.  \\nThe causes of urban heat islands \\nIn addition to the local climate, affected by meteorological parameters such as temperature, \\nrelative humidity, and wind, several human-induced causes are fostering the emergence and \\nintensification of urban heat islands. Such causes are greenhouse gas emissions, the gradual loss \\nof crown cover in urban areas, impermeability, the low albedo and thermal properties of \\nmaterials, urban morphology and the size of cities, and anthropogenic heat.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  4 \\nImpact \\nUrban heat islands can adversely affect both the environment and health during heatwaves. \\nThey contribute to the deterioration of outdoor and indoor air quality and to higher demand for \\nenergy and water.  \\nThe health-related direct impacts of heat include dehydration, hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, or \\nheatstroke. Heat can also exacerbate the symptoms of pre-existing chronic diseases such as \\ndiabetes, mental health disorders, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, \\nneurological, and renal diseases, sometimes fatally.  \\nCertain individuals are more vulnerable to heat, such as those suffering from chronic diseases, \\npersons living alone or experiencing a loss of autonomy, children under 4 years of age, pregnant \\nwomen and their foetuses, or individuals who work in hot environments or engage in intense \\nexercise. Lastly, the elderly, individuals with mental health disorders, and the economically \\ndisadvantaged are groups at greater risk during extreme heat events.  \\nThermal comfort and air conditioning \\nTo reduce individual vulnerability and promote well-being, ambient temperatures must neither \\nbe too low nor too high. While thermal comfort is specific to each individual, the acceptable \\ntemperature range for most people inside buildings appears to fall between 20°C and 24°C in \\nthe winter and between 24°C and 26.5° C in the summer. \\nUnlike central air conditioners, it has been observed that mobile or window air-conditioning \\nunits are less effective in reducing health hazards, except in the case of small volumes of air, e.g., \\ndwelling units with one to three rooms. The size of dwelling units thus appears to affect the \\nefficacy of certain types of air conditioners. In light of the consequences of reliance on large-\\nscale air conditioning, especially on urban heat islands, it is important to contemplate more \\nsustainable solutions both for the environment and the health of current and future generations. \\nSuch solutions must focus on considerations that will affect both the causes of climate change \\nand adaptation to such change.  \\nMeasures to mitigate Urban Heat Islands \\nIncreased albedo in cities through the use of pale materials in infrastructure and buildings \\npromotes cooling by reflecting large amounts of solar radiation. Reflective surfaces thus have a \\nlower temperature than that of conventional coverings such as asphalt and tar and release less \\nheat at night. The impact of high albedo on surface temperature reduction is more significant on \\nsunny days than on cloudy days.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  5 \\nUrban greening actively moderates temperatures through the evapotranspiration process and \\npassively with the shading of surfaces. The highest distance and intensity of the cooling impact \\nconcern major urban parks. The sound growth of trees is essential for them to provide cooling \\nand may depend on soil quality, the availability of water, and sufficient space for the optimum \\nspreading of the root system. Vegetation has an average cooling effect of 1°C to 4.7°C \\nextending from 100 m to 1 000 m in urban areas but is heavily dependent on the amount of \\nwater available to plants or trees. The enhanced resilience of urban forests subject to various \\nmeteorological hazards can be assured through the functional diversity approach, which consists \\nin selecting species with diversified biological traits to limit the risk of canopy loss. The \\ndiversification and increasing complexity of green spaces, especially grassy areas, can be \\neffective in improving their ecological performance from the standpoint of temperature \\nregulation. The revegetation of parking lots creates shade on asphalted surfaces and protects \\nthe coverings from major thermal shifts and prolongs their useful life.  \\nIt is also possible to lower the indoor temperature of buildings by means of the insulation that \\nplant walls, green roofs, or vegetation planted on the periphery of buildings provide, which \\nkeeps heat outside in the summer and inside in the winter. Against a backdrop of growing \\nurbanization, plant walls and green roofs are deemed a promising approach to green cities \\nwhere green spaces are rare and space on the ground is limited. Similarly, they protect buildings \\nfrom ultraviolet rays and significant temperature fluctuations. All urban greening measures \\nafford additional benefits, i.e., improved air and water quality, enhanced urban biodiversity, \\nreduced energy consumption, carbon sequestration, reduced noise, better stormwater \\nmanagement, physical and mental health benefits, and aesthetic and, in certain cases, \\nrecreational functions. \\nBlue spaces refer to outdoor urban surfaces mainly dominated by water, e.g., lakes, rivers, \\nponds, and fountains. Urban blue spaces can simultaneously act as a source of cooling, through \\nevaporation, or a source of heat because of thermal inertia and produce water vapour, thereby \\ncreating thermal discomfort in some instances. The cooling effect of blue spaces varies \\naccording to the time of day and the season. Accordingly, urban blue spaces do not necessarily \\nact as a cooling agent throughout the day since their surface can reach higher temperatures \\nthan their urban environment at night or early in the morning, thereby producing a warming \\neffect. The influence of the geometry and the diversity of urban blue spaces requires more \\nextensive research. Relatively strong winds above the water surface increase evaporation and \\naccentuate the cooling effect. While circulating water such as a river has a more significant \\ncooling effect than stagnant water, the technologies based on water evaporation such as those \\nof a fountain afford the greatest cooling effect. Urban blue spaces can generate between 1°C \\nand 3°C of cooling effect within a perimeter of roughly 30 m.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  6 \\nLimiting soil sealing enhances stormwater management from both a qualitative and a \\nquantitative standpoint. Sustainable stormwater management is an approach that offers \\nnumerous benefits that extend beyond the simple mitigation of flooding and water quality. It \\nmust be deemed a means of combating climate change and phenomena such as urban heat \\nislands that climate change exacerbates. By reducing runoff, the water that infiltrates soil can \\ncool the ambient air through evaporation. It is also essential to consider challenges related to \\nurban heat in architecture and urban planning on a scale ranging from individual buildings to \\nentire cities, especially by initiating reflection aimed at transforming urban areas to make them \\ndenser and enable residents to opt for public and active transportation.  \\nMeasures to mitigate urban heat islands are more effective in combination. Such measures are \\nnumerous and concern areas of expertise such as urban planning, engineering, architecture, \\nlandscape architecture, natural resource management, and transportation. They have a positive \\nimpact on local and global climate. In addition to fostering cooling in urban areas, the measures \\nengender numerous co-benefits, especially reduced energy demand, the reduction at the source \\nof water and air pollution, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, better stormwater \\nmanagement, and increased urban biodiversity.  \\nThis literature review briefly examines the measures to mitigate urban heat islands. Climate \\nchange is already increasing the number of intensive and extreme heat days, a trend that will \\ncontinue in the coming years. It is, therefore, important to bolster the resilience to heat of cities \\nand buildings for the benefit of the health and comfort of the population. While this literature \\nreview in no way replaces the opinions of experts in different fields of land-use planning, \\narchitecture, and engineering, it does review the key thermal management tools.

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  7 \\n1 INTRODUCTION  \\nContext \\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the years 2015 to 2019 were the hottest \\nyears ever recorded around the world (World Meteorological Organization, 2020). From 1948 to \\n2016, the mean annual temperature increased by 1.7°C for Canada as a whole, double the figure \\nfor the rest of the world (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2019). In Québec, 9 of the \\n10 hottest years have been observed since 1998 (Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte \\ncontre les changements climatiques [MELCC], 2021a), a phenomenon attributable to increased \\natmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG).  \\nTwo factors can affect rising temperatures in urban environments, i.e., climate change, and local \\nconditions specific to the city (Dong et al., 2017). According to the projections of the \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is very likely that numerous cities in the \\nworld will experience an increase in the frequency and duration of heatwaves (IPCC, 2015). \\nAccording to the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), it is anticipated that the annual number of \\ndays on which the maximum temperature exceeds 30°C will triple between 2041 and 2070 in \\nmost Québec cities compared with the reference period from 1981 to 2010. In Montréal, the \\nfigure would rise from 12.3 days to 42.8 days, an increase of more than 30 days (Ouranos, 2020).  \\nThis constant increase in the observed and projected temperature exacerbates a known \\nproblem, the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This phenomenon is characterized by higher \\nsummer temperatures in urban areas than in the surrounding rural areas and also between the \\nzones in an intra-urban perimeter, e.g., between a parking lot and an adjacent park. This \\ntemperature difference stems mainly from the built urban environment. UHI can refer to \\ndifferences in the air temperature or at ground level, where it is possible to establish urban areas \\nwith the hottest surfaces (see Section 2.1\\n). According to observations, the average air \\ntemperature in medium-sized to large cities in North America is usually from 1°C to 3°C hotter \\nthan that in surrounding rural areas and can reach up to 12°C higher in certain places, which is \\nparticularly threatening for urban populations (Oke, 1997, cited in Oke et al., 2017). Such \\ndifferences can be even greater when the surface temperatures of an intra-urban UHI are \\ncompared: a 17°C difference was recorded between a park and a nearby parking lot in the \\nborough of Saint-Laurent (Cavayas and Baudouin, 2008).  \\nThe heatwaves in Québec in the summer of 2010 were especially intense and led to 3 400 \\nemergency department admissions and 280 additional deaths\\n12 (Bustinza et al., 2013). The \\nsummer of 2018 was the hottest recorded in 146 years of meteorological observations in \\nsouthern Québec. While excess mortality was lower than in 2010, 86 additional deaths\\n13 \\n                                                      \\n12  Significant excess deaths possibly linked to heat in 2010, compared with 2008 and 2009. \\n13  Significant excess deaths possibly linked to heat in 2018, compared with the period 2013 to 2017.',\n",

More targeted, effective adaptation measures, in particular, may explain such \\ndifferences. The fact remains that repercussions on the healthcare system from the standpoint of \\nhospitalizations, ambulance transportation, and emergency department admissions are \\nsignificant (Lebel et al., 2019). \\nMany cities have adopted measures to mitigate UHI. Such initiatives protect the public by \\nenhancing adaptability to such phenomena. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes \\nthat in the absence of a high level of adaptation, the heat-related morbidity burden will increase \\nagainst a backdrop of climate change and highlights the need to broaden efforts related to \\nhealth action plans to combat heat (WHO, 2021). The WHO recommends that all levels of \\ngovernment adopt measures to protect populations against extreme heat (McGregor et al., \\n2015). \\nObjectives \\nThis publication updates a literature review\\n focusing on measures to mitigate urban heat islands \\nproduced in 2009. Its broad objective is to update the literature review on the measures to \\nmitigate UHI to share current information and present case studies that illustrate the measures. \\nMore specifically, the update seeks to: \\n• compile a list of the key means to mitigate UHI in the scientific literature and grey literature \\nbetween 2009 and 2020;  \\n• list the measures to mitigate UHI according to the four main categories in Giguère’s review \\n(2009), i.e., revegetation measures, measures related to sustainable urban infrastructure, \\nstormwater management and soil permeability measures, anthropogenic (human-induced) \\nheat reduction measures, and other categories if need be, depending on changing scientific \\nknowledge; \\n• provide an overview of measures to mitigate UHI potentially applicable in Québec; \\n• document, by means of case studies, promising examples of achievements to mitigate UHI in \\nthe Québec health and social services network and other organizations. \\nThis review is mainly aimed at public health branch professionals, property managers in the \\nhealth and social services network and the government, and on-site responders in non-profit \\norganizations and the municipal sector. It seeks to inform them of the most recent measures to \\nmitigate urban heat islands potentially applicable in Québec and the measures that foster \\ncooling in urban environments, and to equip them to make decisions and intervene with the \\npopulations most vulnerable to heat.',\n",

Consequently, it is essential to explore the causes and impacts of UHI \\nand the sustainable strategies aimed at mitigating them and adapting to them (see Section 2.2). \\n2.1 Definition  \\nThe city as a whole modifies weather and environmental conditions, which engenders \\ndifferences between the city and the surrounding rural area, especially from the standpoint of \\ncloud cover, precipitation, air temperature, wind speed, and so on. The geometry, spacing, and \\norientation of buildings and outdoor space affects the city’s weather and environmental \\nconditions, which can vary considerably over a distance of several metres. The UHI effect is one \\nof the best known impacts of the influence of the urban environment on such conditions \\n(Kleerekoper et al., 2012). \\nThe expression “urban heat islands” means the temperature difference observed between urban \\nareas and the surrounding rural areas. Observations have shown that the air temperature in \\nurban centres can be up to 12°C higher than in neighbouring regions (see Figure 1) (Oke, 1997, \\ncited in Oke et al., 2017). \\nFigure 1  Profile of an urban heat island \\n \\n  Source: Natural Resources Canada (2004)',\n",

The intensity of urban canopy heat \\nislands is usually higher at night than during the day (Pigeon et al., 2008; Oke, 2009; Oke et al., \\n2017; Filho et al., 2017). \\n2.2 Causes \\nIn addition to the local climate, affected by meteorological parameters such as temperature, \\nrelative humidity, and wind, several human-induced causes are fostering the emergence and \\nintensification of UHI. Such causes are greenhouse gas emissions, the gradual loss of crown and \\nvegetation cover in urban areas, impermeability and the low albedos of materials, the thermal \\nproperties of materials, urban morphology and the size of cities, and anthropogenic heat.  \\n2.2.1 Greenhouse gas emissions \\nGHG retain solar energy in the atmosphere and thus contribute to heating it. According to the \\nIPCC, if GHG emissions continue, they will cause additional heating and a lasting change in all \\ncomponents of the climate system, which will probably increase the likelihood of serious, \\nwidespread, irreversible consequences for populations and ecosystems. It adds that it is very \\nlikely that the frequency and duration of heatwaves will increase and that extreme precipitation \\nwill become more intense and more frequent in many regions (GIEC, 2015). According to \\nOuranos’ climate projections, Québec is one such region (Ouranos, 2020). In 2018 in Québec \\ntotal GHG emissions produced by human activity corresponded to 80.6 Mt of carbon dioxide \\nequivalent (Mt  CO\\n2 eq.), equivalent to 11.1% of Canadian emissions, which stood at 729.3 Mt \\nCO2 eq. For the same year, Québec had the lowest per capita GHG emission rates of the \\nCanadian provinces and territories and hydroelectricity accounted for 93.3% of total electricity \\ngeneration. The main sources of GHG in urban areas in Québec are vehicles, industrial processes, \\nindustrial combustion, and building heating using fossil fuels (Delisle et al., 2020). GHG \\ncontribute to global warming. A lower GHG emission rate for the province does not mean that \\nUHI are less important in Québec.',\n",

Policies \\npertaining to trees have proliferated in Québec municipalities and local commitments to \\nplanting abound. However, such initiatives do not immediately produce results and urban sprawl \\nis simultaneously continuing at an accelerating rate. In particular, urban sprawl in the Montréal \\nand Québec City census metropolitan areas has increased rapidly and more drastically over the \\npast 25 years (Nazarnia et al., 2016). Consequently, a slight decrease was observed between \\n2017 and 2019 in the Montréal metropolitan canopy index (Communauté métropolitaine de \\nMontréal, 2020). The canopy index for Greater Montréal decreased from 26.2% to 26% during \\nthis period, a 764-ha reduction (Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, 2021).   \\nThe loss of crown cover in urban environments is largely attributable to urban sprawl stemming \\nfrom residential, commercial, or industrial development and the absence of adequate protection \\nfor vegetation cover. Urban planted species, especially dominant species, often share the same \\ncharacteristics or functional traits, which reduces the resilience of the urban forest since the \\nspecies are sensitive to the same types of stress (Paquette, 2016). In Québec, as elsewhere, \\ninsects and disease have also decimated certain tree populations, especially ash and elm. The \\nemerald ash borer, an insect that indiscriminately attacks all species of ash and decimates them \\nin only a few years, has led to the disappearance of a number of ash trees on streets, in parks, \\nand on private land in urban centres (Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, 2020). \\nAccording to an American study conducted in 15 states under observation over a period of five \\nyears, the emerald ash borer caused the loss of 100 million trees and was responsible for \\n6 113 additional deaths attributable to respiratory diseases and 15 080 deaths related to \\ncardiovascular disease (Donovan et al., 2013). Climate change is also engendering additional \\nstress on trees in urban areas already subject to ongoing stress through soil compacting and \\nlack of space and are likely to adversely affect the ecosystem services that trees render, \\nespecially the myriad benefits that they offer for the quality of life of residents (Paquette, 2016). \\nThis loss of vegetation implies a loss of cooling in urban settings. Indeed, vegetation plays an \\nessential role in protecting against heat through the phenomenon of evapotranspiration and \\nshading of soil and buildings. During the natural process of the evapotranspiration of water \\nvapour, the ambient air cools by releasing part of its heat to allow for evaporation. Vegetation \\nalso contributes to sound stormwater management and enhanced air quality in cities (Bolund \\nand Hunhammar, 1999; Akbari et al., 2001; English et al., 2007; Cavayas and Baudouin, 2008; \\nGago et al., 2013).',\n",

Natural soils have been replaced by impermeable materials such as asphalt and \\nbuilding construction materials that do not allow for water filtration and absorption modify the \\nnatural path of stormwater (Rushton, 2001; Mailhot and Duchesne, 2005; Coutts et al., 2010; \\nMinistère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs [MDDEFP] \\nand Ministère des Affaires municipales, des Régions et de l’Occupation du territoire [MAMROT], \\nundated; Dagenais et al., 2014). Indeed, in a high-density neighbourhood, the runoff rate can \\nreach up to 55% while in a natural environment it is roughly 1% to 10% (Puget Sound Action \\nTeam and Washington State University Pierce County Extension, 2012, Federal Interagency \\nStream Restoration Working Group, 2001, cited in David, 2017). \\nNatural cooling processes such as water evaporation in soils and the evapotranspiration of \\nvegetation are also restricted and cannot offset urban warming (Brattebo and Booth, 2003, \\nUCAR, 2011, cited in Filho et al., 2017). What is more, impermeable surfacing contributes to the \\ncontamination of receiving watercourses through: \\n• runoff that carries numerous pollutants such as hydrocarbons and pollutants;  \\n• overflowing sewers caused by heavy rains;  \\n• riverbank erosion stemming from the high speed of runoff (Dagenais et al., 2014). \\nAccording to the climate scenarios, such detrimental effects risk increasing in southern Québec, \\nwhere cities will experience heavier rainfall events (Ouranos, 2020). \\n2.2.4 The thermal properties of surfacing materials \\nConcrete and asphalt, the materials commonly used to build roads and roofs, have thermal \\nproperties, including heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and surface radiative properties \\n(albedo and emissivity) that differ significantly from ambient rural areas (Aflaki et al., 2017). \\nImpermeable surfacings and building materials affect the microclimate and thermal comfort \\nconditions since they absorb a great deal of heat during the day and release it into the \\natmosphere at night, thereby contributing to the UHI effect (Asaeda et al., 1996; Fernández et \\nal., 2015). Certain low-albedo materials can reach temperatures of 80°C in the summer (Liébard \\nand De Herde, 2005; Li et al., 2013). The use in cityscapes of heat-retaining materials combined \\nwith the lack of evapotranspiration, for example, because of limited vegetated areas, thus \\ncontributes to the appearance of UHI (Chen et al., 2009, O'Malley et al., 2015, Schrijvers et al., \\n2015, Smith and Levermore, 2008, cited in Aflaki et al., 2017).\",\n",

The presence in major cities of tall buildings can offer numerous surfaces \\nfor the reflection and absorption of solar radiation and is likely to accentuate heat in urban areas \\n(Fernández et al., 2015). The amplitude of the UHI is closely linked to the size of the city (Imhoff \\net al., 2010). Furthermore, densely built neighbourhoods and narrow streets reduce air flow and \\nimpact of natural cooling by retaining and preventing heat from rising skyward (UCAR, 2011, \\ncited in Filho et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2019). Urban morphology is usually quantified by the \\nfollowing parameters: the sky view factor for irregular, complex spaces, or the ratio of building \\nheight to street width and the orientation of street canyons (Lai et al., 2017). The sky view factor \\nis a scale-free number ranging from 0 to 1 that represents the amount of visible sky from a \\ngiven point (Oke, 1988, cited in Lai et al., 2019). A low sky view factor indicates greater \\nobstruction of the sky by urban elements such as buildings and trees, which limits the entry of \\nsolar radiation and promotes the retention of the long-wavelength radiation14 that urban \\nsurfaces emit (Lai et al., 2019). \\n2.2.6 Heat generated by human activities  \\nHeat generated by human activities such as heat emitted by vehicles, air conditioners, and \\nindustrial activity, is another factor that contributes to the UHI effect (U.S. EPA, 2008b; Yang et \\nal., 2016; UCAR, 2011, cited in Filho et al., 2017). This additional heat stemming from human \\nenergy consumption is commonly called “anthropogenic heat” (Dong et al., 2017). Rising \\ntemperatures resulting from anthropogenic heat emissions could lead to growing energy \\ndemand for cooling, especially through air conditioning, which in turn leads to increased \\nanthropogenic heat emissions (Crutzen, 2004, cited in Dong et al., 2017). It has been revealed \\nthat anthropogenic heat from the transportation and building sectors depends on population \\ndensity (Flanner, 2009, Allen et al., 2011, cited in Dong et al., 2017). \\n \\n                                                      \\n14 The solar radiation that Earth receives comprises short-wavelength electromagnetic waves, roughly 30% of which \\nare reflected into space.

Smog is mixture of fine particles and ground-\\nlevel ozone, which is formed by the reaction of pollutants (nitrogen oxides) and volatile organic \\ncompounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. Indeed, a greater quantity of pollutants is \\nreleased in the presence of heat, thereby accentuating smog formation. Air pollution and \\nheatwaves act upon each other (Reeves, 2011). According to a study by Akbari (2005) from the \\nHeat Island Group, 20% of smog concentration in urban areas appears to be attributable to the \\nUHI effect. The resulting increase in air temperature can adversely affect microclimates in cities \\nin relation to rural areas (O’Malley et al., 2015; Radhi et al., 2015), especially through the \\nformation of ground-level ozone (Kleerekoper et al., 2012) and changing local microclimates and \\nmacroclimates, i.e., wind models, changes in humidity, storms, flooding, and changes in local \\necosystems that it can engender (O’Malley et al., 2015). By reducing urban temperatures, all the \\nUHI mitigation strategies can directly affect outdoor urban air quality. For example, a lower air \\ntemperature can slow the photochemical production of pollutants such as ozone (Taha, 1997, \\ncited in Aflaki et al., 2017). \\n3.1.2 The deterioration of indoor air quality \\nAgainst a backdrop of climate change, increased heat and high humidity can affect indoor air \\nquality. Indeed, persistent high temperatures and humidity can result in the degasification of \\nvolatile organic compounds such as formaldehyde or cause a proliferation of undesirable \\norganisms such as mould and mites. Uncontrolled, such conditions can also cause significant \\nthermal discomfort (see section 3.2.1) (Poulin et al., 2016). \\n3.1.3 Higher energy demand \\nIndoor air cooling and refrigeration needs can engender higher energy demand that leads to \\nGHG emissions depending on the energy source employed (Voogt, 2002). A 2°C increase caused \\nby UHI can increase energy consumption by 5% (Anquez and Herlem, 2011).',\n",

Moreover, \\nQuébec City mentions that during heatwaves drinking water consumption can increase by 40% \\n(Ville de Québec, 2021). Such increased demand for drinking water can, in particular, exert \\npressure on infrastructure, make drinking water sources vulnerable, and restrict groundwater \\nrecharge. \\n3.2 Health impacts \\nSweltering heat exacerbated by UHI could increase the number of diseases and deaths \\nattributable to it. In Québec, as elsewhere in Canada and several countries, underprivileged \\nareas tend to be subject to higher average temperatures than comfortably off neighbourhoods \\nsince they are often situated in intra-urban heat islands where green spaces are inadequate \\n(Bélanger et al., 2015). Similarly, individuals living in micro-urban heat islands and who are more \\nlikely to be exposed to higher temperatures are at more significant risk of mortality during hot \\nsummer days (Smargiassi et al., 2009). Researchers have estimated the increase in deaths related \\nto heat spells in Canada between 2031 and 2080 compared with the period 1971 to 2020, which \\nappears to vary from 45% to 455% according to different scenarios that consider GHG emission \\nrates, population growth, and the implementation of adaptation measures (Guo et al., 2018, \\ncited in Health Canada, 2020). \\nUHI can aggravate the effects of soaring temperatures, which can cause direct health-related \\nimpacts such dehydration, hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke. Indirect effects can also \\naggravate underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic debilitating pathologies, respiratory \\nfailure, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, neurological, and renal diseases, to the point of \\ndeath (Health Canada, 2012; Bélanger et al., 2019). Increased morbidity-mortality linked to UHI is \\ngenerally estimated at 20% to 25% (Smargiassi et al., 2009; Bélanger et al., 2015). \\nThe scope and seriousness of adverse health impacts linked to extreme heat events especially \\naffect vulnerable populations, the most disadvantaged of which live in urban environments. \\nLow-quality housing often situated in areas exposed to heat, a lack of infrastructure such as \\nparks and swimming pools, and essential services such as medical services exacerbate the risks. \\nIn Québec, disadvantaged areas are often associated with smaller green spaces and greater \\ndistances between homes and such cooler spaces. Factors that affect indoor temperatures such \\nas the quality of thermal insulation to contend with summer temperatures must also be \\nconsidered since temperatures vary significantly between housing units in hot weather.

They have a positive impact both on the local \\nclimate and the global climate. In addition to targeting cooling in urban areas, the measures \\nengender numerous environmental co-benefits, especially reduced energy demand, the \\nreduction at the source of water and air pollution, including reduced GHG gas emissions, better \\nstormwater management, and increased urban biodiversity. The health co-benefits have also \\nbeen extensively studied and reported, along with spin-off in the realms of social mobilization, \\nenvironment-related education (Beaudoin et al., 2017), or social belonging (Beaudoin and \\nGosselin, 2016).  \\nThe following sections present the measures to mitigate UHI and their efficacy in terms of \\ncooling in urban environments when reported in the literature. The measures have been \\ngrouped into five categories to directly link them to the causes of UHI mentioned earlier: \\n• revegetation and cooling measures; \\n• measures linked to sustainable urban infrastructure (architecture and land-use planning); \\n• sustainable stormwater management measures; \\n• anthropogenic heat reduction measures. \\nIt should be noted that UHI mitigation measures are more effective when combined (Mohajerani \\net al., 2017). Similarly, there is no universal solution to mitigate UHI. The choice of a particular \\nmeasure must satisfy the community’s needs and consider the economic, social, and \\nenvironmental aspects. \\n5.2 Greening measures \\nSeveral studies note the paramount importance of revegetation and the preservation of existing \\ngreen spaces and wooded areas to mitigate UHI in the context of growing urbanization (Heisler \\net al., 1994; Taha et al., 1996; Mcpherson et al., 2005; Solecki et al., 2005; Aflaki et al., 2017; Besir \\nand Cuce, 2018; Aram et al., 2019). Indeed, vegetation creates cooling through the following \\nprocesses: \\n• seasonal shade of infrastructure; \\n• evapotranspiration; \\n• the minimization of temperature differences on the ground.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  23 \\nVegetation also offers other worthwhile, additional benefits in urban environments, including: \\n• enhanced air quality through the production of oxygen, CO2 capture, the filtration of \\nsuspended particulates, and reduced energy demand related to air conditioning; \\n• enhanced water quality through the retention and filtration of rainwater in the ground and \\nthe control of soil erosion; \\n• the absorption of local noise pollution; \\n• the maintenance of biodiversity in cities; \\n• the enhancement of the aesthetic appearance of cities; \\n• health benefits for the population, including protection from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, \\nreduced heat-related stress, and enhanced psychological well-being because of the presence \\nof vegetation and the availability of places in which to engage in physical activity (Beaudoin \\net al., 2017). \\nIn Québec, the vegetation chosen to protect buildings from summer solar radiation must have \\ndeciduous foliage, i.e., lose its foliage during part of the year, but limited branches to reduce \\nshade to a minimum in the other seasons, when solar gain is desired (Écohabitation, 2020a). \\nIndeed, the impact of tree shade on winter heating demand can be significant in the case of \\ntrees with non-deciduous foliage (McPherson, 1994, cited in Kleerekoper et al., 2012). The \\nspecies used in urban revegetation must be chosen judiciously to ensure sound foliage density, \\nwhich will enable the mature tree to filter at least 60% of solar radiation. Ideally, a distance of \\nbetween one-and-a-half times to twice the height of mature trees is ideal between building \\nfaçades and the trees. If the trees are situated farther away, their shade will not cover the \\ndwelling in the summer, and they will not protect it from the wind in the winter (Écohabitation, \\n2020a). Coniferous trees provide less significant cooling in the summer because their foliage less \\nextensively covers the ground and limits the penetration of sunlight in the winter. However, they \\ncan limit the wind chill factor in the winter if properly laid out. In short, no greening measures is \\nin itself perfect, but their complementarity will facilitate enhanced adaptation. Each measure \\nmust be evaluated in light of the planting site, the presence of public service facilities (Gendron-\\nBouchard, 2013) and climatic (resistance to climate change) and anthropogenic (maintenance \\nconditions) disturbances (Paquette and Cameron, undated; Messier, 2020). Large-growing trees \\nmust also be preferred (Paquette, 2016). \\nConsequently, trees must be chosen judiciously. Species such as poplars, oaks, and willow trees, \\nwhich emit volatile organic compounds that are a component of smog, should be avoided \\n(Nowak and Van den Bosch, 2019). Additionally, certain species display allergenicity that can \\naffect human health. According to Laaidi et al. (2011), air pollution and, in particular, high ozone \\nconcentrations, potentiate the action of allergens. Indeed, plants in urban areas are more \\nstressed and pollinate more extensively, which leads to the fastening of certain pollutants to',\n",

To date, the allergenic potential of the most \\npopular tree species in cities and the cross-reactivity of most species are largely unknown or are \\nbased on non-documented methods. According to current knowledge, only a few tree species \\nsuch as birch and alder produce pollen with high allergenic potential (Sousa-Silva et al., 2020, \\n2021). A recent study conducted in five cities, including Montréal, with urban forests and \\ndiffering population densities reveals that the risk of exposure to pollen varies from 1% to 74% \\nfor trees deemed highly allergenic in a given city. Such striking variations in allergenic risk in \\nurban areas stems from a limited knowledge of the allergenic potential of tree pollen (Sousa-\\nSilva et al., 2021). Given that global warming risks extending the pollen season, it is essential to \\ngain a better understanding of tree species with allergenic potential and their distribution in \\nurban spaces to support urban greening (Sousa-Silva et al., 2020). In the meantime, diversified \\nurban forests offer a potentially more reliable strategy to dilute the sources of allergenic pollen \\nin cities (Sousa-Silva et al., 2021). \\nWhat is more, it is essential to adapt the choice of species to the space available. Hydro-Québec \\nis proposing an online tool\\n to select the right trees and shrubs according to the distance from \\nelectric power transmission lines. It is also preferable to choose indigenous species that tolerate \\nQuébec’s climatic variations and urban pollution (\\nhttps://can-plant.ca/).  \\nTo maintain the services that urban forests render, the development of efficient tree \\nmanagement practices aimed at minimizing the mortality risk is thus becoming increasingly \\nimportant. In particular, it is necessary to introduce broader biodiversity in the cities to avoid \\ncrown cover loss when climate change phenomena such as flooding, drought, and high winds \\nweaken species. The species planted in North America are biologically very similar. A diversity of \\nbiological traits such as rapid growth and resistance to shade, drought, and flooding must be \\npreferred to ensure broader functional diversity (see Table 3) and better resistance to different \\nmeteorological hazards, in addition to limiting the risk of canopy loss. Vertical diversity must also \\nbe adopted by integrating herbaceous plants and shrubs into tree planting as well as genetic \\ndiversity by avoiding the same cultivars in a species (Paquette, 2016; Paquette et al., 2021).   \\nUrban environments are constantly changing and there are numerous opportunities to integrate \\nvegetation into urban restructuring, development, or improvement plans. Different applications, \\npresented in the sections that follow, are accessible to municipalities, entrepreneurs, and \\nindividuals to mitigate UHI.',\n",

This principle allows for the use of more varied species or functional groups (Conseil \\nrégional de l’environnement de Montréal, 2019).  \\nThe cooling that vegetation provides can ensure that residents visit certain spaces (Scotland, \\n2008). According to Shashua-Bar and Hoffman (2000), the combined effect of \\nevapotranspiration and shade in parks and green spaces significantly reduces the temperature \\nand even creates what are called cool areas in the city (cited in Gago et al., 2013).  \\nWhile municipalities are mainly responsible for greening public spaces, it is recommended to \\ninvolve residents to promote the social acceptability of such initiatives (Greenspace, 2005, cited \\nin Kleerekoper et al., 2012). The promotion of greening in private spaces is also relevant in cities \\nsince the municipality does not own most of the surfaces exposed to solar radiation. In this \\ninstance, initiatives such as the one that Paris has adopted to promote green façades and \\nterraces (Mairie de Paris, 2009, cited in Kleerekoper et al., 2012), or the green roof subsidy \\nprogram in Rotterdam, define the future trend of adaptation strategies (Waterplan Rotterdam, \\n2008, cited in Kleerekoper et al., 2012). \\n                                                      \\n15  C onsult the Guide pour des plantations résilientes dans les emprises autoroutières.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  28 \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO URBAN GREEN SPACES \\nAccording to Dimoudi and Nikolopoulou (2003), vegetation in sparsely \\nvegetated urban environments significantly enhances cooling. For example, \\na row of trees reduces the temperature of the ambient air by 1°C, while the \\ncreation of a downtown park to replace buildings would generate a drop in \\ntemperature of the ambient air of 2°C to more than 6°C. According to \\nLiébard and De Herde (2005), an average temperature difference of 3.5°C \\nwould also be observable between a sparsely vegetated downtown and \\nneighbourhoods bordering a strip of vegetation between 50 m and 100 m \\ndeep. According to the findings of the comparative analysis of Aflaki et al. \\n(2017), urban greening could considerably mitigate the intensity of UHI, \\nleading to a reduction in the overall air temperature and the mean radiant \\ntemperature to 4°C and 4.5°C, respectively. \\nVegetation has an average cooling effect of 1°C to 4.7°C that extends from \\n100 m to 1 000 m in urban areas but is heavily dependent upon the amount \\nof water available to the plant or tree (Schmidt, 2006, cited in et al., 2012). \\nOther researchers have studied this temperature variation not only in green \\nspaces but also in the surrounding commercial zones. Accordingly, Yu and \\nHien (2006) observed that in Singapore, urban green spaces had a \\nsignificant cooling effect not only in parks but also in nearby urban areas. \\nThe findings reveal that vegetation could lead to energy savings and reduce \\ndemand for cooling in buildings by up to 10% (cited in Gago et al., 2013). A \\ngreen space does not need to be especially big to generate a cooling effect. \\nAccording to a study conducted in Tel Aviv, a park covering only 0.15 ha \\nproduced an average cooling effect of 1.5°C, and 3°C at noon (Shashua-Bar \\nand Hoffman, 2000, cited in Kleerekoper et al., 2012). In their study, \\nShashua-Bar and Hoffman (2000) emphasized that urban vegetation islands \\n60-m wide would generate a sensation of coolness within a 100-m radius. \\nThey also reported that the range of the cooling varied exponentially \\naccording to the dimensions of the vegetated spaces. \\nAs Lachance et al. (2006) observed, in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-\\nMaisonneuve in Montréal in the summer, an area bordering a vegetated \\nzone displayed a surface temperature that was 6°C cooler than an area \\nbordering a vegetation-free industrial area, i.e., 29°C and 35°C, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  29 \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO URBAN GREEN SPACES \\n(CONTINUED) \\nAccording to Charoenkit and Yiemwattana (2016), trees with high canopy \\ndensity or mixed tree species in clusters to create multilayered cover should \\nbe preferred. The findings of the study by Stojanovic et al. (2019) confirm \\nthat green species with a higher proportion of broad, dark leaves such as \\nsycamore maple, Constantinople hazel, littleleaf linden, and horse chestnut \\nreduce air temperature over a wider area.  \\nOther factors can help disseminate the coolness that vegetation creates, \\nespecially the wind: a big park situated above an urban centre in the \\ndirection of the prevailing winds can have a more significant cooling effect \\n(Ca et al., 1998; Honjo and Takakura, 1990). The spatial configuration and \\ntype of vegetation in green spaces appears to jointly affect the efficacy of \\nthe cooling effect (Sodoudi et al., 2018). \\nA study conducted in Tokyo by Ca et al. (1998) has shown that the air \\ntemperature 1.2 m above the ground of a planted surface in a park was 2°C \\nlower at noon compared with the temperature measured in the parking lot \\nof nearby shopping centre. The temperature was 19°C lower at ground level.  \\nGenerally, while the size of urban parks is positively linked to the cooling \\neffect, this relationship is not, however, linear and can even be exponential, \\nespecially because of the time of day when the temperature is recorded \\n(Chang et al., 2007; Hathway and Sharples, 2012; Hayden et al., 2016, cited in \\nYu et al., 2020). Indeed, the authors mention that the cooling distance varies \\nfrom 100 m to 200 m at the end of the day and can extend up to 860 m in \\nthe morning. The distances and intensity of the cooling effect that large \\nurban parks provide are highest when the parks have an area of more than \\n10 ha. Natural elements, the qualities of the urban green spaces, and climatic \\ncharacteristics also significantly affect cooling (Aram et al., 2019). \\nA study conducted in a medium-sized city in the Upper Midwest in the \\nUnited States revealed an average daytime air temperature variability of \\n3.5°C (1.1°C – 5.7°C) in the urban landscape. The temperature decreased in a \\nnon-linear manner with an increase in plant cover. Cooling was more \\nsignificant when the plant cover exceeded 40% (Ziter et al., 2019).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  30 \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO URBAN GREEN SPACES \\n(CONTINUED) \\nWhile grass is preferable to mineralized surfaces, a Montréal study has \\nshown that the diversification and increasing complexity of green spaces, \\nespecially grassy areas, can be effective in improving their ecological \\nperformance from the standpoint of temperature regulation. By comparing \\nmowed grassy areas to three other types of low vegetation, i.e., \\nunmaintained herbaceous fields, unmaintained shrubland, and poorly \\nmaintained shrubby hedges, it was observed that varied gradients of \\ncomplexity mitigated the impact of UHI. Indeed, the other types of \\ninstallation displayed an average surface temperature 5°C lower in relation \\nto mowed grassy areas on a sunny, wind-free day. Similarly, the maximum \\nsurface temperature displayed for shrubland was roughly 20°C lower than \\nthat of the mowed grassy area. The increasing complexity of green spaces in \\nterms of plant species and the height of vegetation can be achieved at low \\ncost by reducing the intensity and frequency of maintenance (Francoeur et \\nal., 2018). \\n5.2.2 One-off planting of trees and vegetation \\nThe sound growth of trees is essential for them to provide cooling and may depend on soil \\nquality, the availability of water, and sufficient space for optimum root development. A tree that \\noccupies limited space in the soil will not attain its maximum size and its lifespan will be \\nshortened (McPherson, 1994). A deep-rooted tree will probably have access to more abundant \\nwater, which will support water absorption. Correspondingly, a deep-rooted tree will transpire \\nmore and provide better cooling (Peters et al., 2010).  \\nThe optimum growth of trees planted along streets is possible through “cellular” arrangements. \\nThere are two types of such plantations. Since they are often confused, the following \\ndesignations are usually used to distinguish them: planting by ecological grouping (companion \\nplanting) and containerized planting or planting in closed trenches.  \\nPlanting by ecological group is often used to renaturalize or preserve natural environments. This \\nentails identifying the natural companions of the tree or shrub and planting them in the same \\nperimeter. For example, brambles (black raspberries), also called the “cradle of the oak tree” or \\n“the mother of the beech tree or American basswood,” are the best companions of sugar \\nmaples. However, it should be noted that this type of companion planting is harder to achieve in \\nurban environments, especially because of the surface available, the client’s willingness to \\ninclude this type of planting, habits (single trees or aligned without shrubs and other \\ncompanions prevail), and the trouble that its implementation causes.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  31 \\nAs for planting in containers, it is very widespread for plant production. Although producers \\ncover their plants to protect them from freezing, losses nonetheless occur. In Québec, the \\nborough of Ahuntsic-Cartierville is testing the cellular technique in the Chabanel district, which \\nis creating a temporary green zone, although its long-term survival is questionable. Cellular \\nlandscape planting is rarer because of the risk of frost, the need to insulate the containers, wind-\\nrelated risks, horticultural obligations that are often deemed excessive, and high mortality. This \\ntype of planting is mainly found near public spaces where installations do not allow for planting \\non open ground, in indoor locations such as shopping centres, or bordering staircases or paths \\nto improve rendering. Containerized planting cannot under any circumstances be deemed \\ngreening since it is not a lasting solution. Indeed, monitoring of the plants is not guaranteed \\nsince they can be moved, and it thus becomes harder to find them in a given territory.  \\nAs for planting in closed trenches, it is often used in engineering to green while protecting \\nunderground facilities (Bassil, personal communication, July 16, 2021). \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO THE ONE-OFF PLANTING OF TREES \\nAND VEGETATION \\nMature trees promote coolness through their evapotranspiration capacity \\nand the area of shade created. A mature tree that transpires 450 l of water \\nallows for estimated cooling equivalent to five air conditioners operating for \\n20 hours a day (Johnston and Newton, 2004). Similarly, a study conducted in \\nManchester revealed that mature trees significantly affect the surface \\ntemperature of the roadway. The findings of the simulation showed that the \\naddition of 5% mature trees in terms of density would reduce the surface \\ntemperature by 1°C (Skelhorn et al., 2014). Nowak and Crane (2002) \\nestimated the carbon sequestration in the trees in urban parks and along \\nstreets at roughly 700 Mt in the United States, with annual average \\nsequestration of 22.8 Mt of carbon (cited in Charlesworth, 2010).  \\nStreet trees may seem to have limited impact on the intra-urban \\ntemperature since they are dispersed but given their significant number they \\nactually have considerable impact. Irrigation can provide additional cooling. \\nBroadbent et al. (2018a) studied the cooling potential of irrigation managed \\nin a targeted manner and observed a reduction in the average daytime \\ntemperature. However, the authors have shown that additional cooling was \\nnegligible when the irrigation rate exceeded 20 l/m2/day.',\n",

Solar absorption by the leaves \\nof plants also apparently strongly depends on their water content, hair, and \\nthe thickness of the leaves. Thick, waxy leaves, such as conifer needles, \\nabsorb up to 88% of solar rays (Jones, 1992; cited in Charoenkit and \\nYiemwattana, 2016). A high leaf surface index is represented by dense leaves \\nwith a greater capacity to block solar radiation (Lai et al., 2019). \\nSunlight can be further reduced by planting trees with broader crowns. \\nDifferent shapes of tree crowns have been studied. Based on the findings of \\ntheir simulation, Milošević et al.

To reduce the heat that asphalted surfaces store, it is advisable to \\ninstall vegetation on the periphery (vegetated areas) and inside (vegetated islands; see Figure 3) \\nparking spaces. The objective is to create shade on asphalted surfaces. Tree shading will also \\nprotect coverings from large temperature variations and prolong their useful life (McPherson et \\nMuchnick, 2005).

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  36 \\n5.2.5 The installation of plant walls \\nAgainst a backdrop of growing urbanization, plant walls and green roofs (see Section 5.2.6) are \\ndeemed a promising approach to greening cities where green spaces are rare and space on the \\nground is limited (Charoenkit and Yiemwattana, 2016). Vertical greenery plays a crucial role in \\nreducing the impacts of UHI, especially in metropolitan cities (Aflaki et al., 2017), where they \\ncreate a microclimate that significantly reduces the temperature of the building envelope and \\nenhances its energy economy (Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008; Ekren, 2017; Vox et al., 2018; Besir \\nand Cuce, 2018). Plant walls shade buildings and promote evapotranspiration in the summer \\nand enhance thermal insulation in the winter (Vox et al., 2018).  \\nSuch plant installations also offer other benefits: \\n• they protect the building envelope from bad weather, capture airborne particles, prevent \\ngraffiti, provide noise insulation and aesthetic enhancement, broaden biodiversity, and make \\na positive contribution to mental health (Ekren, 2017; Vox et al., 2018); \\n• the possibility of establishing the installations on all types of buildings, fences, telephone \\npoles, and streetlamps, and worthwhile greening potential on imposing building façades \\n(Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008); \\n• carbon sequestration (Charoenkit and Yiemwattana, 2016; Zaid et al., 2018). \\nSignificant plant variety will promote biodiversity. However, it must be remembered that \\ndifferent plant species require different habitat conditions. Accordingly, plant species must be \\nchosen carefully (Ekren, 2017). \\nPrecautions must be taken as regards the host structure that has to support the vegetation and \\nthe type of vegetation selected and its potential colonisers (Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008). \\nSimilarly, while it is simple to maintain the vegetation by means of trimming, weeding, and \\ninspection of the support (Courgey and Oliva, 2012), it is harder to carry out maintenance on \\nvertical surfaces (Ekren, 2017). Constant maintenance must be carried out and high costs and \\nproblems related to the irrigation system may arise, especially during winter freeze-ups (Ekren, \\n2017). In Québec, the irrigation system must be drained in the fall with the first frost to \\ncompletely remove water. The wall then enters a period of winter dormancy (Bernier, 2011). It is \\nalso essential to consider that the plant wall applied to the southern façade of a building needs \\nmore water than when applied to the northern façade because of evaporation (Ekren, 2017). The \\nenvironmental and economic sustainability of the systems marketed are, nevertheless, still called \\ninto question since they are highly variable and related to the complexity of the systems, which \\nhampers their widespread use in cities. To enhance the attractiveness of plant walls, technical \\nchanges that incorporate environmental and economic sustainability seem indispensable (cited \\nin Lagurgue et al., 2019). Regular maintenance and the appropriate financial support will \\neliminate such risks (Ekren, 2017).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  37 \\nThere are two types of plant walls (see Figure 6): façade plant walls and living walls. First, the \\nfaçade plant wall is a wall covered with climbing plants rooted in the ground or in pots at \\ndifferent heights on the façade that can climb up to 30 m. A minimum space of 15 cm x 15 cm is \\nrequired on the ground to place the plant there. Certain plants can climb directly on the surface \\nof the wall by means of their morphological characteristics such as aerial roots, leaf tendrils, and \\nadhesive pads (see Figure 7). Second, the living wall, a more complex installation, comprises \\nplants rooted in a medium attached to the wall. The main types of living walls are classified as \\ncontinuous or modular, the main difference being the growing medium (Besir and Cuce, 2018). \\nThe presence of a space, usually from 3 cm to 15 cm, between the building wall and the \\nrevegetation system acts as a thermal buffer, thereby enhancing the building’s thermal \\ninsulation (Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008; Vox et al., 2018). \\nOn the one hand, in relation to façade plant walls, living walls require certain essential materials \\nsuch as supports for the cultivation of the substratum and irrigation systems to maintain various \\nplants. Maintenance costs are, therefore, especially high (Perini and Rosasco, 2013). On the other \\nhand, living walls usually perform better because of precultivated plants and the possibility of \\ntransferring them (Raji et al., 2015). Living walls are also subject to fewer limitations concerning \\nthe application to the upper floors of very tall buildings (Charoenkit and Yiemwattana, 2016). \\nWhile the installation of living walls is still limited and at an experimental stage in Québec, \\nmainly because of cost and maintenance, they are nonetheless adapted to external use (N. \\nZepeda, personal communication, February 10, 2021).  \\nAccording to popular belief, the installation of climbing plants might damage wall surfaces. To \\nthe contrary, most climbing plants cling by means of their extremities that resemble suction \\ncups and prolong the useful life of bricks, stone, paint, dyes, and other materials by protecting \\nthem from bad weather such as temperature changes, wind, rain, and UV rays (Bernier, 2011). \\nThe attachments to the wall can be solid and they must, however, be removed delicately from \\nthe wall to avoid damaging it (Écohabitation, 2021). A multi-year study was conducted in Berlin \\nto evaluate, in particular, the condition of stucco following the installation of climbing plants. \\nMost of the walls in question were covered with Boston ivy, Virginia creeper, and English ivy, \\nplants that are adapted to Québec’s climate. The study’s findings revealed that 83% of the walls \\nwere intact, 16% were slightly damaged, and 1% displayed severe damage in the case of \\nclinging climbing plants and climbing plants with crampon roots. The damaged walls were very \\nold or covered with shoddy stucco. The aerial roots of plants with crampon roots can in point of \\nfact penetrate and widen existing cracks in shoddy or decrepit stucco (cited in Dunnett and \\nKingsbury, 2007).',\n",

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  39 \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO PLANT WALLS \\nThe maximum temperature of plant walls is 30°C, while the temperature of \\ntraditional walls can reach 60°C depending on the type of cladding (Dunnett \\nand Kingsbury, 2008). In California, Sandifer and Givoni (2002) assessed the \\ncooling effect of Virginia creeper on a wall. They observed maximum daily \\nsurface temperature reductions of up to 20°C compared with an unshaded \\nwall.  \\nThe modular systems with vertical vegetated panels appear to surpass the \\nliving wall based on planters in temperate and Mediterranean climates. It \\nwas observed that the average surface temperature of living walls with \\nvertical panels was roughly 8°C to 9°C lower than that of a reference wall, \\ni.e., a temperature reduction 2°C to 3°C higher than that of a plant wall \\nbased on planters (Ottelé, 2011). Luxmoore et al. (2005) modeled the cooling \\ngains generated by the use of vegetation on buildings that form street \\ncanyons in the city. They concluded that the hotter and drier the city’s \\nclimate, the greater the cooling gains. That being the case, cities with hot, \\nhumid climates can also benefit from plant walls to lower by several degrees \\nthe temperature in street canyons. \\nIn Italy, research conducted by Perini et al. (2017) revealed that the average \\nenergy conservation of plant walls was roughly 26.5% in relation to \\ntraditional walls. Under temperate, hot climatic conditions in Oxford in the \\nUnited Kingdom, Sternberg et al. (2011) observed a 9.15°C temperature \\nreduction of the wall generated by a 45-cm thick covering of English ivy on \\na wall with a south-facing wall. \\nA correlation was observed between the thickness of the foliage and the \\ntemperature reductions. Similarly, a 13% to 54% increase in the percentage \\nof foliage appears to reduce the temperature of the outer surface of the wall \\nby 3.7°C to 11.3°C (Koyama et al., 2013). The density and coverage of foliage \\naffect, in particular, shade performance on the building’s façade (Besir and \\nCuce, 2018). The substratum is the most important component of living \\nwalls, especially for the modular system. Its moisture content and thickness \\nare deemed significant factors that affect the thermal performance of living \\nwalls (Charoenkit and Yiemwattana, 2016).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  40 \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO PLANT WALLS (CONTINUED) \\nThe findings of a study of deciduous-leaf vegetation cover by Ip et al. (2010) \\nin the United Kingdom showed the seasonal benefits stemming from shade \\nin the summer leading to a 4°C to 6°C temperature reduction inside the \\nbuilding. When the leaves fell in the fall, all incidental sunlight could \\npenetrate through the windows and heat the inside of the building. \\n5.2.6 Green roof design \\nRoofs account for 20% to 25% of the total urban surface. Consequently, the greening of roofs \\nhas considerable potential to affect temperatures in buildings and the urban environment (Raji \\net al., 2015; Charoenkit and Yiemwattana, 2016; Susca, 2019). Traditional building roofs are dark, \\nwaterproof surfaces that contribute to the UHI effect in cities and increase flooding problems. \\nGreen roofs are solutions for multi-storey buildings, single-family dwellings, commercial \\nbuildings, and other constructions. They enhance the energy performance of buildings and \\nenvironmental conditions (Gago et al., 2013). They simultaneously provide active cooling \\nthrough evaporation and passive cooling through insulation (Aflaki et al., 2017).  \\nBenefits linked to energy conservation, thermal insulation, shade, and evapotranspiration \\nhighlight the key role that green roofs play in the overall thermal performance of buildings \\n(Besir and Cuce, 2018). Traditional roofs are made of asphalt, metal cladding, rubber materials, \\nor typical clay tiles, which considerably increase the surface temperature and readily transfer \\nheat inside the building (Enríquez et al., 2017). Green roofs reduce the amount of heat \\ntransferred from the roof inside the building through evapotranspiration and the shade that \\nplants create. What is more, they cool the outside ambient air (McPherson, 1994) while \\ncontributing to: \\n• enhanced thermal insulation both in winter and in summer through the thermal inertia of the \\nplant cover and the water in the earth or the humidifying cladding; \\n• the aesthetic integration of buildings into the landscape; \\n• potential for urban agriculture; \\n• improved air quality, since the plants on planted roofs trap dust and airborne pollutants; \\n• improved water quality, since vegetation on roofs compensates surface sealing and \\nvegetation cover loss stemming from the ground coverage of buildings (see Section 5.4); \\n• reduced stormwater discharges in sewer systems;  \\n• extending the lifespan of the roof because the green roof affords protection against bad \\nweather, exposure to UV rays, and significant temperature variations, all factors that degrade \\nthe roof (Déoux and Déoux, 2004; Oberndorfer et al., 2007; Besir and Cuce, 2018);',\n",

It is essential for urban planners and political decision-makers to \\nbe aware of their benefits in relation to traditional roofs (Francis and Jensen, 2017). There is \\nenormous potential to install new green roofs on tens of billions of square feet of roofs in North \\nAmerica (Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, 2019) and growing interest in all types of organizations, \\nespecially cooperatives and community-based housing units, which, however, have limited \\nmeans to carry out such work (N. Zepeda, personal communication, February 10, 2021). A \\nnumber of major cities, especially in Europe and North America, are acting by implementing \\nregulatory and economic incentives (Écohabitation, 2017b). In Québec, the adoption of incentive \\npolicies like those implemented in Toronto and Vancouver could promote the use of green roofs \\nin urban environments (Ouranos, 2015). Otherwise, businesses and institutions may perceive \\nsocial responsibility and their image as worthwhile inducements to establish green roofs (N. \\nZepeda, personal communication, February 10, 2021). \\nGreen roofs are best suited to flat roofs or roofs that slope less than 20% (Déoux, 2004, Peck \\nand Kuhn, 2001, cited in MDDEFP and MAMROT, undated), although they are appropriate for all \\ntypes of roofs provided that their structures can bear the weight. Where appropriate, the \\ninstallation of planted roofs can require significant renovations (Fischetti, 2008) and engender \\nsubstantial costs for existing buildings (N. Zepeda, personal communication, February 10, 2021). \\nRegulations that require greater roof bearing capacity for new buildings would facilitate the \\nimplementation of green roofs with a minimum increase in construction costs (Écohabitation, \\n2017b).  \\nA standard green roof comprises several components, mainly a load-bearing structure, a \\nwaterproof pour coat, a barrier coat (if the roof is not ventilated), a root-repelling membrane, a \\ndrainage and filtering section, a geomembrane to retain the soil, a growth medium, and a plant \\nlayer or a substrate layer (Besir and Cuce, 2018). Figure 8 presents the main components of a \\ngreen roof.',\n",

It was observed that \\nextensive green roofs engendered significantly fewer adverse environmental impacts than \\nasphalt or gravel roofs (Centre international de référence sur le cycle de vie des produits, \\nprocédés et services, 2011). Figure 9 shows examples of extensive green roofs. \\nAs Table 4 illustrates (Pisello et al., 2015), there are three categories of green roofs: extensive, \\nsemi-intensive, and intensive, according to the weight, the substrate layer, maintenance, cost, \\nthe plant species introduced, and irrigation. Intensive roofs are the heaviest and are more \\nexpensive than the other types of roofs. Furthermore, they require a higher level of \\nmaintenance. Extensive roofs do not have additional weight because of the shallower growth \\nmedium and their maintenance costs are particularly low (Coma et al., 2016).',\n",

They \\nreveal that sedum, grasses, and very rustic hardy perennials appear to be highly successful on \\nextensive roofs, which require plants resistant to the Québec climate’s temperature and humidity \\nvariations (Monterusso et al., 2005). While green roof irrigation systems are necessary in hot, \\narid regions, they are unnecessary in humid, temperature climates (Besir and Cuce, 2018). \\nBased on the studies conducted, it has been concluded that an appropriate growing \\nenvironment should mainly comprise high-porosity, low-density inorganic matter and only 0% \\nto 20% organic matter to increase water retention capacity and promote nutrient recycling. A \\nmixture of several organic materials such as soil, clay, and green waste composted in a green \\nroof substratum appears to promote plant growth and contribute to increased carbon \\nsequestration in green roof systems (Charoenkit and Yiemwattana, 2016). Humidity and \\ntemperature variations should also be considered when plants are chosen for green roofs.  \\nIn recent years, some developed countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, \\nSingapore, and Japan have put forward new standards aimed at the profitable, economical \\nmodernization of energy use in existing buildings and new applications built with green systems. \\nA standard has been adopted in Canada to ensure that green systems cover between 20% and \\n60% of the roof surface when the building’s floor area exceeds 2 000 m\\n2 (Besir and Cuce, 2018).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  45 \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO GREEN ROOFS \\nThe interior temperature of buildings under green roofs is likely to be \\ncooler, which reduces the need for air conditioning and, therefore, energy \\nconsumption and carbon emissions (Charlesworth, 2010). The annual carbon \\ncapture of green roofs is on the order of 0.375 kg/m2 to 30.12 kg/m2, while it \\nfalls between 0.14 kg/m2 and 0.99 kg/m2 for vertical green systems (Besir \\nand Cuce, 2018). \\nOf all the types of roof covering (traditional, reflective coating, plant), the \\ngreen roof achieves the most cooling. A dark roof exposed to the sun can \\nreach 80°C, a white roof, 45°C, and a green roof, 29°C (Liu and Bass, 2005; \\nFischetti, 2008; Perrin, 2020).  \\nNiachou et al. (2001) analyzed the thermal properties of green roofs and \\nconcluded that, during the summer, they maintained low indoor daytime air \\ntemperatures and higher nighttime temperatures, compared with a \\nconventional roof. However, they observed that night ventilation maintained \\nlower temperatures day and night. Accordingly, energy consumption in \\nbuildings equipped with green roofs was lower than consumption for non-\\ngreen roofs and could even be enhanced through natural ventilation during \\nthe summer (cited in Gago et al., 2013). Buildings equipped with green roofs \\nappear to consume 2.2% to 16.7% less energy in the summer than those \\nequipped with conventional roofs. A similar trend has been observed in the \\nwinter according to regional and climatic conditions (Besir and Cuce, 2018). \\nAnnual energy demand appears to be lower for intensive green surfaces \\n(8.2 kWh/m2) compared with semi-intensive (12.3 kWh/m2) or extensive \\n(23.6 kWh/m2) green surfaces. The temperature difference between \\nconventional roofs in the winter appears to be roughly 4°C, compared with \\nroughly 12°C in the summer (Silva et al., 2016). \\nIt has been observed in several studies in the literature review that the \\ncharacteristics of green roofs affected the thermal and energy performance \\nof buildings. Moreover, such performance is greater when the substratum is \\nthick (Permpituck and Namprakai, 2012, Liu and Minor, 2005, cited in Besir \\nand Cuce, 2018) and the water content is high in the summer and low in the \\nwinter (Lazzarin et al., 2005, cited in Besir and Cuce, 2018). It should be \\nnoted that it is advisable to use a moist substratum in the summer and dry \\nsoil in the winter. Indeed, dry soil is used to increase heat storage and',\n",

A study based on \\nfour North American cities showed that thicker soil achieved greater energy \\nsavings in all the cities, including Toronto and Vancouver (Mahmoodzadeh \\net al., 2020). \\nThe cooling that green roofs engender is not negligible. In Chicago, an \\nintensive roof installed on a city hall had an average annual temperature 7°C \\nlower than the surrounding conventional roofs, a difference that could reach \\n30°C during the hottest periods of the summer (Daley, 2008). In Ottawa, Liu \\n(2002) drew similar conclusions: the same roof half covered by vegetation \\ncover and half covered with conventional asphalt covering displayed a \\ntemperature difference of 45°C on a 35°C sunny day. Similarly, were Detroit \\nto green all of its nearly 15 000 ha of roofs, 55 252 tonnes of carbon could \\npotentially be sequestered (Getter and Rowe, 2009, cited in Charlesworth, \\n2010). \\nAccording to the literature, based on 17 studies that provide original data on \\nthe reduction of UHI, the maximum cooling of green roofs at street level \\nappears to vary between 0.03°C and 3°C. The study that presents the \\nsmallest cooling effect (0.03°C) is noteworthy since it considers the coverage \\nof only 25% of the green roof instead of 100% as do most of the other \\nstudies (Gromke et al., 2015). On a pedestrian scale, intensive green roofs \\ncould engender double the cooling effect in terms of the heat felt compared \\nwith extensive green roofs (Berardi, 2016). According to their study \\nconducted in Singapore, Wong et al. (2003) indicated that the installation of \\ngreen roofs on buildings less than 10 m tall would engender a cooling effect \\nat street level. Similar findings were observed in France (Berardi, 2016) and \\nToronto (Ouldboukhitine et al., 2014, cited in Lai et al., 2019). The street-\\nlevel cooling effect for green roofs installed on medium-height (roughly 30 \\nm) and tall (roughly 60 m) buildings would, however, be negligible (Lai et \\nal., 2019). \\nSookhan et al.

They observed \\nthat sedum surpassed a mixture of perennial grasses and indigenous \\nherbaceous flowers during the overall interannual investigation period. The',\n",

The findings emphasize the durability of sedum as a plant for the \\nextensive cooling of green roofs and the importance of plant selection and \\nthe determination of the traits that correspond not only to summertime \\nmicroclimatic conditions but also to wintertime conditions. \\nSusca et al. (2011) studied during daily rush hour in New York the surface \\ntemperature of a 10-cm thick green roof encompassing 1 000 m2 of sedum \\nwith an albedo of roughly 0.2. It was between 1°C and 8°C lower than the \\ntemperature of the white membrane (albedo 0.6), while the reflecting \\nmembrane was 1°C to 5°C cooler than the green roof during the night. The \\nfindings also revealed that the installation of a green roof instead of a \\nreflecting roof led to energy savings ranging from 40% to 110% and the UHI \\nmitigation potential was greater.  \\nWhile cooling effects are higher in cities with dry climates, the building’s \\ncharacteristics also define the possible contribution of green roofs \\n(Santamouris, 2014). Summertime air conditioning needs can be reduced by \\nmeans of a green roof, especially for roofs that were originally less well \\ninsulated. In fact, energy use can be relatively stable up to a certain \\ntemperature. Beyond this critical threshold, a 2°C increase due to UHI can \\nincrease energy consumption by 5% (Bass et al., 2003). Research conducted \\nin southern Italy revealed that uninsulated green roofs were roughly 12°C \\ncooler than traditional roofs according to average summertime temperature \\nmeasurements. Likewise, the wintertime temperature difference between \\ntraditional roofs and green roofs was nearly 4°C (Bevilacqua et al., 2017). \\nNumerous researchers have studied both experimentally and digitally the \\npotential energy savings stemming from green systems in buildings. The \\nobservations reveal that green roofs reduced summertime and wintertime \\nheat loss from the roofs by roughly 70% to 90% and 10% to 30%, \\nrespectively (Besir and Cuce, 2018).',\n",

Airborne particles and combustion gases retain the radiation. Daylight harvesting, \\nsun-shading devices, and urban design are significant energy conservation strategies that \\nreduce the UHI effect (Tsangrassoulis et al., 1999, Ferrante and Cascella, 2001, cited in Gago et \\nal., 2013). UHI results from the heat that the surfaces that dominate the urban environment \\nabsorb, then radiate. Reflective materials are used to increase the albedo of cities. Instead of \\nabsorbing sunlight, the surfaces reflect most of it, thereby reducing the local heat effect. \\nMethods such as surface painting aimed at increasing the albedo are relatively simple and \\ninexpensive to implement (Yang et al., 2015, cited in Leal Filho et al., 2018; Qin, 2015). \\n5.3.1 Buildings \\nThe materials used in building façades significantly affect urban heat balance. The solar rays that \\nconstruction materials absorb are dissipated through convective, radiative transfer into the \\natmosphere and consequently raise the temperature of the ambient air. The appropriate \\nselection of materials can thus reduce energy consumption and enhance the comfort of \\nbuildings and urban spaces (Santamouris et al., 2011).  \\nBuildings that integrate protection against heat usually have openings \\nequipped with sun-shading devices, reflective materials, and, occasionally, \\nclever natural cooling systems.  \\n5.3.1.1 Choice of reflective materials \\nThe higher the reflectivity (albedo) and emissivity of a material, the lower the risk of storing heat \\nand diffusing it in the atmosphere or inside a building through the walls and the roof (Paroli and \\nGallagher, 2008; Synnefa et al., 2007).  \\nThe reflectivity of surfaces refers to their capacity to reflect solar radiation, a property called \\nalbedo. Albedo is represented on a scale of 0 to 1. A high albedo, which approaches 1, means \\nthat the surface reflects a great deal of solar radiation. Accordingly, the more reflective a surface \\nis, the higher its albedo (see Table 5). Clear, shiny surfaces have higher albedo values than \\ndarker, more opaque ones (Gago et al., 2013).  \\nEmissivity is the property of a material to disseminate the energy that it accumulates. Energy \\nthat is not diffused contributes to surface heating. The emissivity coefficient of a material \\ndepends on its surface condition and, for a metal, its degree of oxidation. The coefficient is also \\nexpressed as a value falling between 0 and 1. A material displaying lower emissivity is a better \\nthermal insulating material (Liébard and De Herde, 2005).',\n",

In the same way, it has been observed that the impact \\nof high albedo on surface temperature reduction is more significant on sunny days than on \\ncloudy days (Rosso et al., 2016). \\nRoofs can be painted white to increase their albedo. The paints now on the market can reflect \\nup to 90% of solar rays (Perrin, 2020). The roofing materials industry has recently developed \\nhigh-performance roofing materials such as elastomeric or polyurea membranes, pale tiles and \\ngravel, whose albedos are all higher than those of traditional materials (Akbari et al., 2006; \\nPerrin, 2020). The use of such materials is recommended solely for flat roofs in regions subject \\nto UHI since they can create dazzling when installed on sloping roofs (Nikolopoulou, 2004; \\nPerrin, 2020).  \\nFourth-generation reflective materials based on nanotechnological additives such as \\nthermochromic paints and tiles (Ma et al., 2001, 2002; Karlessi et al., 2009) or phase-change \\nmaterials (PCM) (Karlessi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2007; Pasupathy et al., 2008; Cabeza et al., \\n2007) have been developed and will probably be used for future applications for reflective roofs \\n(cited in Santamouris, 2014). Over time, all reflective materials lose some of their reflective \\nefficiency because of the dirt that settles on the covering (U.S. EPA, 2012). It has been shown \\nthat because of the effects of alteration, the potential of reflective materials is reduced by at \\nleast 25% during the first year following their installation (Lontorfos et al., 2018).

The studies revealed that they can reflect a high rate of near-infrared \\nradiation, which constitutes half of solar energy (Akbari et al., 2006). The colours of coverings \\nmade up of these pigments are visually similar to those of conventional roofs, but their \\nreflectivity capacity is appreciably higher (Levinson et al., 2005). \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO REFLECTIVE MATERIALS \\nGenerally speaking, when the albedo increases by 0.1, the ambient \\ntemperature on hot days can be reduced by roughly 1°C (Santamouris, 2014). \\nA simulation focusing on Montréal showed that an increase in albedo from \\n0.2 to 0.85 would reduce annual temperatures by 0.2°C and up to 4°C on hot \\ndays (Touchaei and Akbari, 2015). A dark, low-albedo roof covering can \\nreach a temperature of 50°C higher than that of the ambient air while, \\naccording to Akbari et al. (2001), a high-albedo roof will reach a maximum \\ntemperature of 10°C higher than that of the ambient air. This surface can \\ncontribute greatly to the reduction of air conditioning needs (Écohabitation, \\n2020c). American studies have shown that the reduction in air conditioning \\nneeds might reach between 13% and 40% depending on the cities \\n(Konopacki et al., 1998). In the same way, a California study established that \\nthe addition of high-albedo colour pigments when roof coverings are \\nmanufactured could reduce air conditioning needs by 10%, ambient heat by \\n1°C to 1.5°C, and smog by roughly 5% (Akbari et al., 2006). The use of low-\\nemissivity reflective materials appears to generate more cooling in urban \\nenvironments and thereby enhance air quality by minimizing smog \\nformation (Taha, 1997a). \\nA study conducted for the Greater Toronto Area estimated air conditioning \\ncosts could be reduced by some $11 million (150 GW) if the city installed \\nwhite roofs and adopted a greening strategy (Akbari and Konopacki, 2004). \\nSnow also reduces heating demand for a reflective roof, thus contributing to \\nhigher overall annual savings on energy expenditures (Hosseini and Akbari, \\n2016). A simulation study showed that with a 100% increase in local albedo \\n(0.15 to 0.30), a reduction in the ambient temperature was almost negligible, \\nwhile when the local albedo stood at 0.45 (a 200% increase), the peak',\n",

(2011) reported in their study conducted for several American \\ncities using simulation techniques that the nighttime temperature of green \\nroofs was nearly 1.5°C to 2.0°C higher than that of reflective roofs (albedo of \\n0.7). Conversely, during the daily peak period, the corresponding surface \\ntemperatures were almost equal. The reflective roof’s lower nighttime \\nsurface temperatures and the relatively higher surface temperature of the \\nplant-covered roof are attributed to radiative cooling and the storage \\ncapacity of the soil, respectively. \\nAn experiment was conducted in London to measure the temperature \\ndifference on two walls that both received the same rate of solar radiation \\nsituated in the same urban canyon. A high-albedo material (0.50) covered \\none of the walls and a low-albedo dark material (0.03) covered the other \\nwall. Different measurements were recorded on a sunny afternoon and the \\ntemperature of the reflective surface was 6°C to 10°C cooler during this \\nperiod. To conclude, if all surfaces had good reflective capacity, the \\ntemperature in the canyon could have been reduced by 3°C to 4°C at the \\nhottest time of the day (Watkins et al., 2007). \\n5.3.2 Bioclimatic architecture \\nThe principles of bioclimatic architecture protect buildings from summertime overheating since \\nthey consider climatic and environmental conditions. From envelope design to building \\norientation, bioclimatic architecture makes every effort to ensure the occupants’ thermal \\ncomfort, thereby protecting the most vulnerable individuals from heat (Liébard and De Herde, \\n2005; Agence de l’environnement et de la maîtrise de l’énergie, 2012). This approach is based on \\nmultidisciplinary research, which ensures the development of sound buildings that are \\ncomfortable for their occupants, do not disturb the environment, and contribute to biodiversity \\n(Widera, 2015). \\n5.3.2.1 Insulation and air tightness of buildings \\nWhile insulation and air tightness are parameters associated with cold climates, they are also \\nindispensable to control coolness inside buildings. They prevent cold or heat from penetrating \\nbuildings through the walls, the roof, the ground, or windows, and thus mitigate the occupants’ \\nthermal discomfort (Déoux et Déoux, 2004).',\n",
       " \"Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  52 \\nSound building insulation conserves heat in the winter and avoids overheating in the summer. It \\nis assured, in particular, by installing thicker insulation on the building envelope and installing \\ndouble- or triple-glazed windows (Écohabitation, 2020a). Building insulation is especially \\neffective when the envelope displays few or no thermal bridges. Thermal bridges usually stem \\nfrom design or construction flaws in the insulating envelope that allow air to enter the building \\nin the winter and do not keep it cool in the summer. They engender thermal discomfort and \\nover-consumption of energy for heating and air conditioning. They can lead to condensation \\nzones and, consequently, the development of mould (Liébard and De Herde, 2005). \\nImproved air tightness can also reduce air flows between the outside and the inside of a \\nbuilding. It also controls humidity, which can cause health problems and thermal discomfort. To \\nlimit the transfer of heat and humidity on either side of building envelopes, specific \\nconstruction, insulation, and sealing processes are applied to new buildings (Poulin et al., 2016). \\nIn the same way, better sealing must be combined with a properly maintained, appropriate \\nventilation system that ensures healthy indoor air quality and cools the ambient air at night if \\npossible (Déoux and Déoux, 2004).  \\nWhen they are concomitantly, optimally applied, such techniques that affect building envelopes \\noffer a passive, energy-efficient solution to deal with heatwaves and protect vulnerable \\npopulations from their effects (Santamouris et al., 2010, cited in Poulin et al., 2016). Several \\nbuilding certification systems are available in Québec, some of them recognized the world over, \\nsuch as the LEED and ENERGY STAR programs. Similarly, the Novoclimat 2.0 program\\n16, which \\nalso specifies technical requirements to ensure better energy performance, greater comfort, and \\nimproved indoor air quality (Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles, 2016), is offered \\nfor new building or major renovation projects carried out in Québec south of the 51st parallel \\n(cited in Poulin et al., 2016). \\n5.3.2.2 Maximization of thermal inertia \\nThe thermal inertia of a building is its capacity to store then diffusely release heat. The higher \\nthe building’s inertia, the slower it heats up and cools down (Écohabitation, 2012b). \\nHigh-inertia materials allow for excess heat accumulation and storage, which avoids heat in the \\nambient air and improves thermal comfort. The heat that high-inertia materials contain will be \\ndiffused between six and 10 hours after the materials start to accumulate the heat, i.e., toward \\nthe end of the day when it will be possible to let cooler air enter the home (Hollmuller et al., \\n2005; Agence de l’environnement et de la maîtrise de l’énergie, 2012). Stone, concrete, bricks, \\nand raw earth are examples of materials with good thermal inertia. \\n                                                      \\n16  Novoclimat – Critères d’admissibilité : \\nhttps://transitionenergetique.gouv.qc.ca/residentiel/programmes/novoclimat-professionnels-\\nconstruction/novoclimat-petit-batiment-multilogement#c4809.\",\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  53 \\nTo maximize the cooling potential that high-inertia materials afford inside buildings, it would be \\nideal to place high-inertia walls in sunny locations and ensure that at least 50% of the room \\nwalls are high inertia (Courgey et Oliva, 2012; Agence de l’environnement et de la maîtrise de \\nl’énergie, 2012). High thermal inertia avoids overheating by conserving cool nighttime air \\nthroughout the day, while maintaining coolness in the building through sound insulation and air \\ntightness. \\n5.3.2.3 The use of high-performance glazing \\nGlazing is a weak point in a building’s thermal insulation both in summer and in winter \\n(Armstrong et al., 2008). However, it is possible to enhance the performance of thermal \\ninsulation, in particular by choosing: \\n• smart anti-emissive glazing, which reduces sunlight inside a building. Such glazing adapts \\naccording to the seasons and the angle of inclination of the incident rays: they allow \\nwintertime light to pass when the sun is lower and limit summertime solar radiation when it is \\nhigher (Armstrong et al., 2008); \\n• double- or triple-glazing with gas space or inert gas, which minimize heat exchanges through \\nconduction and convection. Air acts as insulation and double- or triple-glazing that encloses \\na 16-mm to 20-mm air space increases the insulating capacity. The insufflation of non-\\nflammable, non-toxic argon or krypton gas to replace air affords better insulation in such \\nglazing. Sealed double glazing with a low-emissivity coating, an insulating-glass spacer, and \\nargon produces performance similar to that of triple glazing at optimum cost effectiveness \\nwithout the potentially harmful weight of the latter glazing when the window is opened and \\nthe loss of light entry through triple glazing (CAA-Québec, 2021; Écohabitation, 2018); \\n• self-adhesive plastic film that blocks 99.5% of UV radiation and 86% of solar energy \\n(Filmpourvitre.com, 2021a, 2021b).  \\nFrank (2005) specifies that one simpe way to bolster the thermal inertia of the building envelope \\nis to limit the extent of glazed surfaces (cited in Poulin et al., 2016). In the same way, at least \\n60% south-facing glazing is to be preferred to optimally recover heat from sunlight. North- and \\nwest-facing openings are to be minimized since they display poor energy balance \\n(Écohabitation, 2018). \\nLow-solar-gain glazing also exists and could solve the problem of summertime overheating. \\nHowever, its use would lead to a wintertime loss of solar heat gain and thus to higher energy \\ndemand. Researchers at the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa conducted a study \\nto compare the year-round energy performance of two types of low-emissivity glazing, i.e., \\nhigh-solar-gain glazing and low-solar-gain glazing. It showed that the use of high-solar-gain \\nglazing should be advocated in cities in which are recorded more than 3 000 Celsius degree-\\ndays, i.e., most Québec cities. The use of high-solar-gain glazing also appears to engender a',\n",

Unless they can be covered outside, it is \\nhighly inadvisable to incorporate them into the building to avoid the attendant greenhouse \\neffect that can require energy-intensive air conditioning (Courgey and Oliva, 2012; \\nÉcohabitation, 2020a). Compared with conventional skylights, tubular skylights appear to be \\nbetter adapted to Québec’s climate, especially because of enhanced air tightness, greater \\nluminosity, and a reduced greenhouse effect in the summer (Écohabitation, 2020a). \\nAs for old windows, a complete change is necessary only if the frame is damaged, the insulation \\nhas deteriorated, or there are numerous leaks. Otherwise, it is relatively simple and inexpensive \\nto change the glazing. It is also possible to add additional glazing to the existing window or to \\napply a surface film (Écohabitation, 2018). Under Québec’s climatic conditions, the ideal \\nsituation is to take advantage of winter sunshine and rely on sun-shading devices to protect \\nagainst it in the summer. \\n5.3.2.4 The addition of sun-shading devices \\nIn addition to vegetation, which, as noted earlier, is an excellent means of protecting the \\nbuilding envelope from direct sunlight, glazing and building sun-shading devices are other \\nsolutions to limit the contribution of heat from solar rays. Unlike interior protection, sun-shading \\ndevices are installed outside around the windows or on them to block summertime solar rays \\nwhile allowing light to enter. Table 6 presents different types of sun-shading devices. \\nRecourse to fixed solar masks requires precise proportioning to avoid losing the benefits of \\nwintertime sunlight (avoid installing an overly long sunshade that will block wintertime entry of \\nsunlight when the sun is lower) (Courgey and Oliva, 2012). While interior sun-shading devices \\nsuch as opaque shades or blinds are much less effective in protecting the building interior from \\nsummertime overheating, they must be clear and cover the entire surface of the window \\n(Courgey and Oliva, 2012). A Canadian study conducted by the National Research Council of \\nCanada showed that half-closed revolving shutters installed on the windows of a typical North \\nAmerican house could reduce air conditioning needs by 67% during the hottest weeks of the \\nsummer (Écohabitation, 2020b).',\n",

As \\nnoted earlier, large paved urban areas such as schoolyards, roads, and parking lots are often \\ncovered with asphalt or concrete. Such surfacings have a very low albedo. This results in a higher \\nambient temperatures, typical of the UHI effect, which can reach 80°C under the summer sun \\n(U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, 2019). \\nTypical albedo values range from 0.04 to 0.16 for asphalt roadways and from 0.18 to 0.35 for \\nconcrete roadways (Pomerantz et al., 2003), although the albedo of new concrete can reach 0.69 \\n(Marceau and VanGeem 2007, cited in U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway \\nAdministration, 2019). Since the thickness of the pavement affects its ability to store heat, \\nthinner surfaces are to be preferred for low albedos, which absorb heat (Golden and Kaloush, \\n2006). The albedo of an asphalt surface is higher in the winter than in the summer since in the \\nwinter the asphalt surface can be covered with ice or snow so that the colour of the asphalt is',\n",

Changes in albedo of 0.2, in the \\nsummer, to 0.3 or 0.35, in the winter, have thus been observed (Hermansson, 2004, cited in \\nBobes-Jesus et al., 2013). In the same way, it should be noted that the albedo of roadways \\nchanges over time. The albedo of concrete roadways decreases and that of asphalt roadways \\nincreases as they age (EPA, 2008, cited in U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway \\nAdministration, 2019). \\nTo minimize heat accumulation in pavement, the following techniques can be used to increase \\nits albedo. \\n• Inverted pavement: existing asphalted roads comprise roughly 85% mineral aggregate \\ncovered with 15% bitumen. One way to increase the albedo of asphalt is to invert the manner \\nin which the pavement is manufactured, i.e., by spreading a thin layer of bitumen on which \\nhigh-albedo aggregate is placed, e.g., 0.60. The aggregate thus exposed increases the \\nreflectivity rate of the surfacing, which reduces the temperature of the pavement. However, \\nthese types of pavement are inadvisable for high-speed roads since the pieces of aggregate \\ncan unstick and break windshields and affect user safety.  \\n• Coloured asphalt and concrete: the addition to asphalt and concrete of reflective pigments \\nincreases their reflectivity. \\n• A thin layer of concrete: a layer of concrete is added to the surface of asphalt pavement in \\ngood condition (Lai et al., 2019). Concrete has a higher albedo (from 0,30 to 0.40 when new), \\nwhich maintains a cooler surface temperature. This method appears to be very effective and \\nallow for the circulation of all types of vehicles (Winkelman, 2005; Synnefa et al., 2007). \\nWith specific reference to bituminous pavement, most losses of reflectivity occur during the first \\nmonth of use, which is attributable to the significant deposit by automobile traffic of rubber on \\nroadway surfaces. The loss of reflectivity observed for concrete pavement is fairly gradual over \\ntime and stems mainly from significant dust deposits on its surface (Lontorfos et al., 2018). \\nAs is true of buildings or pavement, paints with high solar reflectivity rates are available for \\nvehicles and businesses should recommend their use. Such paints are made up of special \\npigments that increase by 17.5% on average their albedo (Ihara, 2006).',\n",

According to a comparative study of the state of pavement in several \\nAmerican cities, the heat in the city appears to affect the rate of \\ndeterioration of the composites of asphalt. Lighter paving thus appears to \\nhave a better useful life (Heat Island Group, 2021). \\n5.3.4 Urban planning \\n5.3.4.1 Recommendation of well spaced out urban morphology \\nThe distribution of urban structures and buildings in a city affects the formation of UHI since it \\ncan determine the absorption of solar energy and formation of wind currents. The performance \\nof an urban area as regards solar radiation and airflow between buildings also plays a role in the \\ndispersal of airborne particles and pollutant gases. The urban response to solar radiation and \\nairflow can be controlled through urban design (Ratti et al., 2003, cited in Gago et al., 2013). \\nKristl and Krainer (2001) have conducted an energy assessment of the urban structure and the \\nproportioning of parcels of land. They observed that a north-south orientation was more logical \\nfor low buildings (6 m high). Conversely, no orientation was preferred for average-sized (12 m) \\nand tall (36 m) buildings. An increase in the width of buildings appears to reduce the impact of \\nthe orientation in the case of low buildings (cited in Gago et al., 2013). In the same way, a more \\nrandom arrangement of tall buildings can reduce the UHI effect (Cheng et al., 2006, cited in \\nGago et al., 2013). \\nUrban morphology can, in particular, generate urban canyons that confine heat and airborne \\npollutants (Gago et al., 2013). According to Ratti et al. (2006), maximum turbulence is necessary \\nto disperse pollutants (cited in Gago et al., 2013). The consideration of wind in urban planning \\nprocesses can lead to effective cooling of buildings in urban areas (Kleerekoper et al., 2012). \\nSimulations conducted by Wang and Akbari (2014) in four typical urban neighbourhoods in \\nMontréal revealed that an increase in the sky view factor led to a daytime temperature reduction \\nof the air. At night, in the absence of direct sunlight, open spaces allowed for greater heat loss \\nskyward through long-wave radiation, which lowered the air temperature. \\nThere exists a correlation between morphological indicators such as rugosity, built density, \\nsurface albedo, and urban geometry, and heat in urban areas. Research has established this \\nrelationship between urban morphology and microclimates (Fouad, 2007; Pinho et al., 2003; \\nNikolopoulou, 2004; Gago et al., 2013).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  58 \\nUHI effects are relatively weak and can become negative, thereby creating a cool island, in the \\nparts of the city where tall buildings create extensive shade and the high thermal capacities of \\nconstruction materials slow heating (Oke et al., 2017). Johanson (2006) showed that even if a \\nshallow canyon is uncomfortable in the summer, wintertime sunlight makes it more comfortable \\nthan a deep canyon (cited in Lai et al., 2019). A compromise between summer and winter must \\nbe contemplated when urban morphology is designed for outdoor thermal comfort, especially \\nin temperate regions (Lai et al., 2019). Wind flow is channeled in the canyon if the street is \\noriented in a direction parallel to that of the wind. In coastal cities, an effective ventilation \\nstrategy consists in orienting streets parallel to the sea breeze. Ng (2009) suggested limiting the \\nangle between a street and the orientation of wind flow to less than 30 degrees to obtain good \\nventilation in high-density cities (cited in Lai et al., 2019). \\nUrban planners can foster residents’ thermal comfort by focusing on the following concerns in \\nthe urban planning process: \\n• land-use planning that targets good summertime wind circulation, which is very useful in \\ncities with a high degree of humidity. Combined with this development strategy, vegetation \\nand water (jets, falls, and fountains) can create additional coolness; \\n• the development, sound distribution, and preservation of green spaces. Urban green spaces \\nshould be properly distributed to facilitate access to them, i.e., less than a 20-minute walk \\nfrom any dwelling. Ideally, they must create green corridors that pedestrians can easily use. \\nLarge green spaces situated upstream from the city in line with the prevailing winds can also \\ncontribute to cooling the air; \\n• mixed uses that allow for the development of continuous trips intended for active \\ntransportation and that promote access to recreational and social areas and to essential \\nservices such as food stores, near dwelling places; \\n• the promotion of mass transit, the limitation of the use of privately-owned motor vehicles, \\nand urban development inspired by transit-oriented development (see section 0) (U.S. EPA, \\n2008b); Coutts et al., 2010; Nikolopoulou, 2004; Vivre en Ville, undated). \\n5.3.4.2 The development of blue spaces  \\nThe term “blue spaces” refers to outdoor urban surfaces that are mainly dominated by water, \\nsuch as lakes, rivers, ponds, and fountains. Static lakes and ponds and dynamic rivers and \\nstreams have the potential to lower the surface temperature through constant evaporation, \\nespecially on sunny days (Yang et al., 2020). However, evaporation appears to increase humidity \\naround water bodies, which appears to reduce thermal comfort (Yu et al., 2015). On the one \\nhand, the flow characteristics of dynamic water bodies can play a significant role in the spatial \\ndistribution of heat release since rivers can move the stored energy downstream (Hathway and \\nSharples, 2012; Kleerekoper et al., 2012). On the other hand, given the limited movement of',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  59 \\nwater in static water bodies, the latter tend to be more sensitive to heat transfers between the \\nwater and the air (Ampatzidis and Kershaw, 2020).  \\nThe cooling intensity of water is apparently generally stronger in low-altitude cities than in high-\\naltitude cities (Yu et al., 2020). In the same way, the cooling effect appears to depend on \\nseasonal and diurnal variations (Ellison et al., 2017). When a water body is integrated into the \\ncity core, an oasis effect can be observed during the day (Ampatzidis and Kershaw, 2020). \\nRelatively strong winds above the water surface increase evaporation and accentuate the \\ncooling effect, while higher water vapour content limits heat loss through evaporation and can \\nreduce the cooling effect (Webb and Zhang, 1999, Stathopoulos, 2006, cited in Ampatzidis and \\nKershaw, 2020). Because of their high thermal capacity, water bodies can, however, have a \\nwarming effect if the surrounding urban areas cool more rapidly (Broadbent et al., 2018b).  \\nThe capacity of a water body to cool the surrounding urban environment depends chiefly on \\nlocal environmental and meteorological conditions such as ambient temperature, humidity, wind \\nspeed and direction, and the inherent properties of water (Ampatzidis and Kershaw, 2020). The \\ncooling effect of water on sunny days is more significant than on cloudy days since the higher \\nsolar radiation on sunny days provides additional energy for the evaporation of water and the \\nreduction of the air temperature (Lai et al., 2019). \\nSmall installations or expanses of water such as ponds, fountains, and water jets act as thermal \\nbuffers since they moderate temperature fluctuations, thereby creating microclimates. It should \\nbe noted that large water bodies increase the spreading of sound and should be avoided in very \\nnoisy urban areas (Déoux and Déoux, 2004).  \\nFrom a strategic standpoint, high cost makes difficult the promotion of the use of blue spaces to \\ntake advantage of the evapotranspiration effect. The installation of fountains can be deemed a \\nsound cost-benefit option in specific, high-use spaces such as streets and business premises. \\nWith intelligent design, it is possible to use the same space for other purposes in the winter \\n(Kleerekoper et al., 2012).  \\nDifferent facilities can be offered to the public, such as aquatic areas, ponds, and mist makers. \\nMore recently, reflecting pools (a thin film of water spread over slabs) are also enabling \\nresidents to cool off. Spraying or misting processes promote evapotranspiration by maximizing \\nthe contact surface between air and water and thus accentuate the cooling of the ambient air.

The ambient air provides the water with the energy to evaporate, \\nand the evaporation process thus cools the ambient air. \\nFigure 10  Fountains and a swimming pool \\n \\n      Photo credit: Ville de Québec. \\n5.3.4.3 Installation of cooling areas  \\nAccess to cooling areas such as shopping centres, schools, cultural centres, or any other air \\nconditioned public building open to the public is sometimes essential to alleviate the \\ndetrimental effects on residents of sweltering heat. It is also important to provide for assistance \\nfor individuals unable to move about alone to access such sites (English et al., 2007; Widerynski \\net al., 2017). Rest areas such as shelters or airconditioned centres must also be available for \\noutside workers. Data show that individuals at low risk go more often to cooling centres than \\nhigh-risk individuals, which highlights the need to encourage those most at risk to visit cool \\nzones (Kovats et al., 2006, cited in Widerynski et al., 2017). According to Kosatsky et al. (2009), in \\nMontréal 25% of 238 elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases stated that they would \\nrefuse to seek shelter in a cooling facility in the event of a prolonged heatwave because of \\nconcerns related to sleeping in a dormitory or not deeming themselves sufficiently ill to need \\nsuch a facility (cited in Widerynski et al., 2017). \\nCOOLING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO BLUE SPACES AND COOLING \\nFACILITIES \\nBlue spaces can engender a cooling effect of 1°C to 3°C within roughly 30 m \\n(Kleerekoper et al., 2012).

The size and shape of blue spaces are \\nimportant variables as regards the cooling obtained in urban environments, \\nbut there is no consensus in the literature because of the different sites and \\nclimates where the studies were conducted (Ampatzidis and Kershaw, 2020). \\nBlue spaces are usually more effective when they have large areas or when \\nthe water flows or disperses, such as from a fountain (Kleerekoper et al., \\n2012). By focusing mainly on the studies that involve technologies based on \\nwater evaporation, such as sprinklers, water curtains, or fountains installed \\nin public spaces to mitigate heat stress, it has been observed that, on \\naverage, water-based techniques afford an average cooling effect of 1.9°C \\nand that the higher the temperature of the air, the higher the cooling \\npotential is (Santamouris et al., 2017). \\nVölker et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis that compiles the empirical \\nfindings drawn from static and dynamic water bodies that evaluate the \\nimpacts of blue spaces on the temperature in relation to a reference urban \\narea. The median temperature difference was 2.5°C, which indicates a high \\ncooling effect. The meta-analysis of Gunawardena et al. (2017) revealed that \\nblue spaces can engender nocturnal warming, which more extensively \\naffects thermal comfort and human health. In Brazil, Targino et al. (2019) \\nobserved that Lake Igapó was warmer than the neighbouring green park \\nthroughout the day but relatively cooler than the urban environment. It \\nshould be noted that the measurements were made in late fall. Indeed, \\nwarming is usually more apparent at the end of the summer when the water \\ntemperature reaches its maximum because of the accumulated heat \\n(Gunawardena et al., 2017). Li and Yu, 2014, cited in Ampatzidis and Kershaw \\n(2020), also mention the higher cooling potential of green parks. The studies \\nhave shown that the expansion of green spaces appears to offer more \\nextensive benefits than the expansion of water bodies. Green spaces appear \\nto be more likely to provide constant daytime and nighttime thermal effects \\nin relation to blue spaces (Sun et al., 2018). Hathway and Sharples (2012) \\nobserved that in Sheffield in the United Kingdom the cooling effect of water \\nbodies only occurred during the day and varied from 0.25°C to 1.82°C (cited \\nin Yu et al., 2020).',\n",

In the same way, the shores of \\nlakes with heavy vegetation play a more important role in cooling the air \\ntemperature than the shores of lakes made up of permeable or \\nimpermeable materials (Yang et al., 2020). According to their study \\nconducted in Bucharest, Romania, Robitu et al. (2004) observed that a 4-m x \\n4-m pond could also cool an urban environment in the summer by \\ndisplaying a cooling effect of roughly 1°C at a height of 1 m, measured at a \\ndistance of 30 m (cited in Kleerekoper et al., 2012). Other studies \\ncorroborate the efficacy of ponds from the standpoint of urban cooling: one \\nof the first studies to measure the cooling effect of an urban pond was \\nconducted in Fukuoka, Japan, by Ishii et al. (1991), who observed a 3°C \\nreduction in the air temperature. Nishimura et al. (1998) subsequently \\nconducted a similar study in Osaka, Japan, on two consecutive typical \\nsummer days under clear skies during the day. The findings revealed a \\ntemperature reduction of up to 2°C on the lee side of the pond.  \\nIn the same way, observations stemming from a study conducted in Tel Aviv, \\nIsrael, show a nearly 1°C reduction in the ambient temperature for a small \\npond (40 000 m2) during the day, which indicates that even small blue \\nspaces can provide cooling effects. Syaffi et al. (2016) used an experimental \\nmodel reduced to the scale of an urban island in Saitama, Japan, to study \\nthe thermal effects of a pond. Despite a cooling effect of nearly 2.5°C during \\nthe hottest part of the day, they also observed that during the night the \\npond could be warmer than its urban environment. Using the same model, \\nSyaffi et al. (2017) studied the effect of different sizes and configurations of \\nponds on urban thermal regulation capacity. The findings showed that the \\nbigger the pond, the greater the cooling effect in the surrounding area.

Lastly, Syafii et al. (2017) also emphasized the possible negative impact \\nof higher humidity that might hamper thermal comfort (cited in Ampatzidis \\nand Kershaw, 2020). \\nAmpatzidis and Kershaw (2020) conducted a meta-analysis to examine the \\nthermal effects of static blue spaces on the urban climate. While studies that \\nrely on remote sensing to study UHI in Europe are relatively fewer in \\nnumber, they suggest that water bodies can mitigate urban air temperatures \\nfrom 1°C to 10°C. Similarly, it was observed that blue spaces were the key \\ncooling mechanism in an urban area in Toronto, Canada.  \\nWater micronization techniques such as spraying micrometer-sized airborne \\nwater droplets promote the cooling of ambient air. Their effect is maximized \\nin a hot, dry climate but also allows for cooling gains in environments where \\nthe relative humidity is higher, especially when cooling by air movement is \\npossible (Liébard and De Herde, 2005). In the wake of a heatwave that struck \\nEurope in 2003, French researchers conducted a study focusing on the use \\nof a fogger in a gerontology centre in Marseille. The device’s use in the \\nliving room where caregivers and residents mingle led to a 3°C indoor \\ntemperature reduction (Bonin-Guillaume, 2005). \\n5.3.4.4 The use of sun-shading devices in public areas \\nDirect sunlight raises the temperature that individuals feel and has an appreciable impact on \\ntheir thermal comfort (Watkins et al., 2007). As is true of buildings or infrastructure, shade partly \\nprotects individuals from direct sunlight and the UV rays that cause skin cancer. An array of \\noptions ranging from “natural shade” to “built shade” can provide shade. The first option relies \\non trees, big shrubs, vines, and ground cover to block direct UV rays and absorb indirect UV \\nrays. The second option is designed and configured to satisfy specific needs and relies on \\nmanufactured components (Toronto Cancer Prevention Coalition, 2010). To this end, pergolas, \\nawnings, or parasols, for example, can be installed in places of public use to protect residents \\nfrom sunlight.  \\n5.3.4.5 The choice of materials in parks \\nIt should be noted that that the materials used in artificial surfaces absorb and store heat, \\nthereby considerably increasing the surface and air temperatures and amplifying the UHI \\nphenomenon (Macfarlane et al., 2015). Several studies have showed that the temperature of \\nartificial turf could exceed surrounding temperatures by 10°C (De Carolis, 2012; Government of',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  64 \\nWestern Australia, 2011; McNitt et al., 2007). Another study, conducted in Montréal, attempted \\nto compare the surface temperatures of artificial, natural, and maintained grass. The average \\ndaytime surface temperature of synthetic turf was 17.4°C higher than maintained grass and \\n10.3°C higher than natural grass. However, this temperature difference was less pronounced at \\nnight (the temperature was 2°C higher compared with natural grass and 0.6°C lower compared \\nwith maintained grass) (Canuel Ouellet, 2017). \\n5.4 Sustainable stormwater management measures  \\nClimate change is likely to affect southern Québec’s rainfall regime especially through the rising \\nintensity of annual maximums and more intense, frequent rainfall. Combined with growing \\nurbanization, such changes may engender increased volumes and peak urban runoff flows, \\nthereby leading to greater risks of flooding, overflowing sewers, and the degradation of water \\nquality in receiving water bodies (Dagenais et al., 2014). \\nSustainable stormwater management is an approach that offers numerous benefits that extend \\nbeyond the simple mitigation of flooding and water quality. It must be deemed a means of \\ncombating climate change and phenomena such as urban heat islands that climate change \\nexacerbates. By promoting infiltration, evaporation, and evapotranspiration by means of \\nvegetated structures, the literature widely mentions the attendant benefits both from a \\nhydrological (a reduction of volumes and peak flows), aesthetic (a contribution to the urban \\nlandscape), or environmental (reduced UHI, broader biodiversity, and enhanced air and water \\nquality) standpoint (Dagenais et al., 2014; Flanagan et al., 2017).  \\nSeveral studies establish a correlation between the soil moisture level and UHI mitigation. \\nIndeed, through evaporation, moist soils have cooling capacities similar to those of vegetation \\nand their surface temperatures are cooler than those of dry soils (Lakshmi et al., 2000; Sun et \\nPinker, 2004). Accordingly, a moist substratum allows for better heat dissipation and minimizes \\nsummertime cooling demand (Castleton et al., 2010; Raji et al., 2015). To promote the humidity \\nof soil in urban areas and ensure the availability of water for plants, there are several sustainable \\nstormwater management and water pollution control practices. They reflect the low-impact \\ndevelopment approach that calls for broader management that considers various scales, ranging \\nfrom the drainage basin to the private lot, as well as development interventions. This approach \\nseeks to imitate natural or pre-development hydrology by limiting disturbances in natural \\nenvironments during development to reduce runoff at the source and control pollutant \\nconcentrations (Credit Valley Conservation and Toronto and Region Conservation, 2010; \\nDagenais et al., 2014). \\nTo ensure the efficiency and safety of small-scale developments, the sites where they are \\nestablished must be subject to preliminary studies. The proximity of a water table, the \\ngranulometry of the soil, and pollution risks are all factors to consider when measures are',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  65 \\nintroduced that target the infiltration of stormwater in the soil. In the case of sites such as \\nparking lots and industrial sites where sediments and pollutants are present, rigorous follow-up \\nand maintenance must be carried out (MDDEFP and MAMROT, undated; Dagenais et al., 2014). \\nStormwater management practices can be divided into three categories: (1) practices focusing \\non pre-treatment such as filter belts; (2) practices related to the transportation of runoff such as \\nvalley gutters; and (3) practices geared to infiltration or retention at the source such as green \\nroofs and bioretention zones, or at the conclusion of the treatment process, such as filter \\nmarshes. Given the difficulty of introducing valley gutters and filter belts in existing built \\nenvironments because of the space they require, the practices presented in this section are \\nrelated to infiltration or retention at the source. Similarly, related to the low-impact \\ndevelopment approach that targets control at the source and because of the lengthy period of \\nretention of the water (≥ 24-48 hours) that can be conducive to the proliferation of mosquitos, \\nend-of-treatment practices are not examined in detail (Dagenais et al., 2014). \\n5.4.1 Planting trees and installing green roofs \\nThe promotion of greening must go hand in hand with that of enhanced stormwater \\nmanagement (Kleerekoper et al., 2012). The root system of trees greatly maximizes water \\nseepage. Plants with thicker roots appear to be especially effective in creating pores of \\nsignificant dimensions that promote stormwater infiltration. Interception rates vary according to \\nage, type of bark, the extent of foliage and thus the season, the architecture (the size and \\narrangement of small branches), the density of forest stand, and the species present. Other \\nfactors also affect the interception of rain, such as the intensity and duration of the rain and \\nwind speed. Generally speaking, trees intercept the most rain, followed by shrubs, bushes, and \\ngrasses (Dagenais et al., 2014).  \\nIt is acknowledged that the revegetation of urban areas and the installation of planted roofs \\nenhance air and water quality, lower the ambient temperature, and reduce energy demand \\nrelated to air conditioning (Niachou et al., 2001; Missios et al., 2005; Charlesworth, 2010; Gago et \\nal., 2013). Vegetated installations can also capture large amounts of stormwater (Gill et al., 2007; \\nDeNardo et al., 2005; Charlesworth, 2010; Gago et al., 2013; Besir and Cuce, 2018), which offsets \\nthe loss of vegetation cover stemming from the presence of buildings on the ground (Agence \\nde l’environnement et de la maîtrise de l’énergie, 2012). The characteristics of green roofs affect \\ntheir water retention capacity, including the depth of the substratum, the slope of the roof, the \\ntype of plants, and the intensity of precipitation (Oberndorfer et al., 2007). To avoid increasing \\nthe content of phosphorous and other pollutants in water following movement through green \\nroofs, it is important to carefully select the growth medium and adjust the fertilization \\naccordingly. Lastly, plants also appear to be useful to limit clogging of the surfaces of \\nstormwater infiltration systems (Dagenais et al., 2014).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  66 \\nRETENTION BY TREES AND GREEN ROOFS OF RAINWATER  \\nAn extrapolation of the potential of public trees in Montréal to intercept \\nprecipitation shows that the trees now capture roughly 2.2% of rainwater \\n(Vergriete and Labrecque, 2007). Another study concluded that the \\nrainwater retention capacity of a 10-cm thick green roof was roughly 60% \\n(Moran et al., 2005). Rainwater retention appears to vary from 25% to 50% \\nfor thinner substrata. The literature indicates that extensive roofs could \\nretain a maximum of 45% of water while intensive roofs appear to retain up \\nto 75% (Carter and Keeler, 2008). A modelling study showed that if 10% of \\nroofs in Brussels were green roofs, total runoff would be reduced by 2.7% \\n(Mentens et al., 2006).  \\n5.4.2 The choice of permeable coverings   \\nThe porous surface of permeable coverings captures precipitation and surface runoff that allows \\nthe water to slowly infiltrate the soil (Selbig and Buer, 2018).  \\nSuch coverings engender benefits from the standpoint of reduced rainfall runoff, the protection \\nof soils through water infiltration, or a reduction in urban heat through hydrothermal exchange. \\nSoils covered with gravel have been used for a long time as permeable coverings. They allow for \\nsound water seepage in the soil when the latter is not too compact but are not valued in urban \\nenvironments (Gilbert and Clausen, 2006).  \\nOther types of permeable coverings include: \\n• impermeable slabs (paving stones) arranged contiguously that allow rainwater to percolate in \\nthe permeable joints (see Figure 11). This type of covering can be used if the soil on which it \\nis installed is permeable, on varied sites such as schoolyards, pedestrian streets, alleyways, \\nparks, pedestrian access routes, bicycle paths, and parking lots. It is not suitable for airports \\nor freeways since it is vulnerable to abrupt braking and heavy weights; \\n• porous concrete slabs or coverings that allow water to flow through small cavities. This type \\nof paving is obtained by eliminating or reducing the finest materials (sand and finer \\naggregates). Porous concrete usually has 20% voids (pores) in relation to its total volume and \\ncan allow water to infiltrate at a speed of 5 m/h to 45 m/h (Pilon et al., 2019). Its maintenance \\nrequires cleaning by vacuum cleaner or water jet to remove substances that can plug the \\ncavities. Its use is recommended for pedestrian footpaths since the absence of a joint does \\nnot afford the slabs considerable mechanical strength; \\n• the honeycomb shape of the structures that facilitate sodding allows for the revegetation of \\nthe soil and promotes water infiltration in the soil. The structures can also bear the parking of',\n",

(Coste and Noel-Letendre, \\n2019).  \\nPorous coverings can pose certain challenges since they allow water to infiltrate to the \\nfoundation layers, which can affect structural integrity when heavy loads are applied or during \\nfreeze-thaw cycles. The design of materials and the foundation must also consider both \\nstructural capacity and permeability. Similarly, they require regular maintenance and specific \\npractices to avoid the contamination of the water table and clogging. Spreading sand in the \\nwinter is not appropriate since it can accelerate clogging in the covering (MDDEFP and \\nMAMROT, undated). \\nWATER INFILTRATION CAPACITY RELATED TO PERMEABLE COVERINGS  \\nAccording to the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (2020), \\npermeable, porous pavers appear to facilitate the infiltration of 70% to 80% \\nof annual rainfall. What is more, a study that compared three types of \\nparking lot coverings, i.e., asphalt, permeable pavers, and rock dust, showed \\nthat permeable pavers foster greater filtration of pollutants and better \\nrunoff water purification (Gilbert and Clausen, 2006).  \\nVaillancourt (2018) characterized the infiltration capacity of five permeable \\npaving sites in Greater Montréal. The author observed very high infiltration \\ncapacity on the sites. Rainfall data were analyzed on one of the sites and the \\nfindings revealed a reduction of between 6 mm and 12 mm in the volume of \\nrunoff per rain event and up to a three hours time-lag in the peak flow.  \\nPilon et al. (2019) conducted a study in Tennessee, in the United States, \\nfocusing on a water quality assessment on a site comprising both \\nimpermeable asphalt and permeable concrete parking lots.

The installation will usually comprise a mixture of \\nhardy perennials, ornamental pasture, and deep-rooted woody shrubs that are adapted to both \\nwet and dry conditions. It is essential to ensure that the soil is permeable up to a depth of 0.6 m \\nto 1.2 m under the rain garden (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2011). When a rain \\ngarden is well designed, all stagnant water should disappear after 24 to 48 hours (Franti and \\nRodie, 2013).  \\nIt is advisable to situate the rain garden at least 3 m but not more than 9 m from the house, \\ninstall it on a gentle slope of less than 12% and far from cabling, gas mains, buried pipes, and \\nseptic tanks. It is also advisable to consider runoff from neighbouring land that can flow toward \\nthe site of the rain garden. To ensure the durability of rain gardens, the addition of a layer of \\norganic mulch retains moisture in the soil during periods of drought. Similarly, the selection of \\nplants that do not require frequent pruning and fertilization minimizes rain garden maintenance \\n(Franti and Rodie, 2013). \\nPrivate gardens can be used as rain gardens, thereby promoting slow water infiltration. The \\nRoyal Horticultural Society (2005) notes that the capacity of an average suburban garden is \\n10 l/min of water, equivalent to 10% of the incident precipitation absorbed. Cumulatively this \\ncould represent thousands of litres of water that might be diverted from a city’s sewer system \\n(cited in Charlesworth, 2010). \\nWATER INFILTRATION CAPACITY RELATED TO RAIN GARDENS   \\nThe impact on runoff following the installation of experimental rain gardens \\nin a residential district was compared with that of a similar district without a \\nrain garden. It was noted that the volume of runoff in the district with rain \\ngardens was 90% lower than that in the reference district (Richards, 2009, \\ncited in Boucher, 2010). \\n5.4.4 Retention pond design   \\nA retention pond is an installation of the same type as a rain garden but of a bigger dimension \\nin which the slope of the land creates a depression. The depression collects the water than runs \\ninto it and lets it infiltrate the soil (U.S. EPA, 1997). There are two types of retention ponds, i.e., \\npermanently contained water pools that permanently preserve stagnant water, and dry lagoons, \\ndesigned to collect certain types of flow and that empty fairly quickly and stay dry in the \\nabsence of precipitation. Among dry lagoons, those with prolonged containment retain water \\nfor frequent events lasting from 24 to 48 hours, thereby enhancing water treatment. This type of \\ninstallation also affords other benefits such as the creation of plantscapes, indeed of play areas \\nand recreational areas (dry lagoons) in urban environments.

Installations of this type have been carried out in \\nBoucherville, where retention ponds integrated into the green and blue belt create connectivity \\nbetween the ecosystems.

Heat \\nproduced inside a building contributes to its overheating in the summer period, especially when \\nadded to direct sunlight or poor thermal insulation in the building.

This type of lamp consumes one-fifth the amount of energy and \\nlasts 10 times longer than an incandescent lamp and provides the same level of lighting. \\nHowever, caution must be exercised when such lamps are discarded since they contain mercury. \\nThey must be returned to a retailer that offers a recovery service (Association provinciale des \\nconstructeurs d’habitations du Québec, 2008). Unlike incandescent light bulbs, which use only \\n5% of the electricity that they consume to produce light and dissipate the remainder in the form \\nof heat, light emitting diode (LED) light bulbs use energy efficiently, with energy savings of 70% \\nto 90% in relation to incandescent light products (Hydro-Québec, 2021a). \\nAnother way to control the heat generated by artificial light is to regulate its use. There are \\nseveral ways to do so: \\n• control the luminous flux by continuously adjusting artificial light according to the natural \\nlight coming from outside; \\n• ensure hourly control by means of clocks of the illumination on sites such as commercial \\nenterprises, office buildings, and schools where lighting needs are fixed; \\n• use timers to briefly light sites that are intermittently visited; \\n• use motion detectors to only light a site when it is occupied; \\n• use lighting cells, devices placed in a room or on the building that measure the natural \\nlighting and adjust artificial light needs solely when required (Liébard and De Herde, 2005). \\nIt is also worthwhile for certain buildings such as hospitals and schools to maximize the use of \\nnatural light, except on premises such as laboratories where the lighting must be constant. \\nHowever, natural light entries must be equipped with sun-shading devices to protect the \\noccupants from direct solar rays (Liébard and De Herde, 2005). \\nWhat is more, when new buildings are erected, natural light gains should be optimized to \\nreduce dependency on artificial light. To this end, a study of the site’s seasonal lighting capacity \\nmust be conducted at the outset of the construction project (Salomon and Aubert, 2007). \\n5.5.1.2 The proper use of electronic and electric devices \\nAll electronic and electric devices emit heat, even in sleep mode. The use of computer and \\nelectric equipment with high energy efficiency is therefore strongly recommended. Moreover, to \\nminimize heat gain, it is important to turn off and unplug the devices when they are not in use',\n",

Indeed, simply plugging in a cell phone charger or an external power \\nadapter for a laptop uses energy even if it is not connected to the device that it is powering, or \\nthe device is fully charged. Electronic devices certified ENERGY STAR limit the amount of energy \\nthat is consumed in sleep mode, i.e., a 40% to 50% reduction in energy consumption for a \\ntelevision set, and 70% for a computer, compared with conventional devices (Transition \\nénergétique Québec, 2021a). \\nIndoor heat gains quickly warm the ambient air, above all if the buildings are constructed with \\nlow-inertia materials that cannot absorb a lot of heat. On hot days, it is appropriate to limit the \\nuse of electric household appliances such as dishwashers, washers, and dryers, and run them \\nonly when they are full and in economy mode. For example, washing garments in cold water \\nsaves more than 50 l of hot water per load. Likewise, it is inadvisable to place a refrigerator \\ndirectly beside a stove, dishwasher, or sunny window, since it will run longer to reach the desired \\ntemperature (Transition énergétique Québec, 2021b; Agence de l’environnement et de la \\nmaîtrise de l’énergie, 2021). \\nHousehold appliances and electronic devices are very energy intensive and account for one-fifth \\nof the total energy consumed in a home (Transition énergétique Québec, 2021b). It is \\nrecommended to use a switched power bar since it allows for several devices to be plugged in \\nand shut off at the same time (Agence de l’environnement et de la maîtrise de l’énergie, 2021). \\nUHI have an impact on demand for energy, especially because of air conditioning and \\nrefrigeration. Higher demand may be such that it causes an overload that overwhelms the \\nelectrical power grid. To avoid such a situation, the choice of ecoenergetic certified devices is \\nrecommended (Association provinciale des constructeurs d’habitations du Québec, 2008). \\n5.5.2 Reduction of the vehicle fleet in urban environments \\nAutomobiles and other vehicles emit heat and GHG. In Québec, in 2018, the road transport \\nsector accounted for 35.6% of total GHG emissions (Delisle et al., 2020). The total heat that \\nvehicles emit can be trapped in poorly ventilated urban canyons, thereby reducing the thermal \\ncomfort of residents. Vehicle emissions also contribute to the formation of urban smog and \\nglobal warming (Watkins et al., 2007; Younger et al., 2008; Ouranos, 2010). Between 1990 and \\n2017, when Québec’s population rose by only 25%, the fleet of passenger vehicles for personal \\nuse increased by 64%. Similarly, from 2000 to 2017, the number of light trucks, which includes \\nSUVs, pickup trucks, and vans for personal use, increased by 128% in Québec, i.e., an increase \\nfrom 24% 39% in the proportion of light trucks in the total passenger vehicle fleet during this \\nperiod (Laviolette, 2020). Given that electric vehicles emit much less heat than conventional \\nvehicles for a given kilometrage, their replacement can mitigate the UHI effect by reducing the \\nenergy consumption of air conditioners (Li et al., 2015). Sound transportation planning, \\nincluding active and public transportation, is thus essential to minimize heat gains in urban areas \\n(Coutts et al., 2010).',\n",

It seeks to satisfy certain core principles: \\n• urban growth that hinges on structuring, structured mass transit networks by means of a \\nnetwork of varied, quality public venues that emphasize human-scale architecture; \\n• the development of dense, multi-purpose districts that offer a mixture of activities and \\ngreater proximity to services that promotes recourse to public and active travel; \\n• consideration of the overall life environment, i.e., the district’s location, its relationship to the \\nexisting city, and its vocation and boundaries (Vivre en Ville, 2013).  \\nFurthermore, it has been observed that greater urban density may lead to a corresponding \\nreduction in energy consumption (Mindali et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2012, cited in Gago et al., 2013). \\n5.5.2.2 Encouraging mixed uses \\nSeveral studies have showed that mixed uses in the vicinity promotes accessibility and thereby \\nreduces automobile traffic. In residential areas, road traffic is lighter in districts where \\ncommercial enterprises are accessible on foot than in districts without such enterprises, where \\ncar travel is inevitable (Rancourt, 2019; Robitaille et al., 2017; Vivre en Ville, undated). In addition \\nto encouraging active travel and making services more accessible to residents, mixed uses also \\npromote the establishment of neighbourhood life. Indicators can help to establish the definition \\nof respectable proximity, such as the number of dwellings situated less than a certain distance \\non foot from commercial enterprises, the number of jobs within a determined radius, or the \\npresence of social, cultural, and educational services (Écohabitation, 2017a). \\n5.5.2.3 Development centred on active and public transportation  \\nAutomobiles are currently the main means of transportation for 80% of Quebecers (Gravel, \\n2014). One conceivable solution to ensure greater coolness in urban areas is to limit access to \\nthem and vehicle traffic. Some means of achieving this end are:  \\n• the control of traffic flow by means of traffic by-laws on hot days; \\n• higher parking costs in the city; \\n• the establishment of tolls to travel in specific areas of the city and the gradual reduction of \\nparking spaces;',\n",

The \\nimpacts related to heat and air pollution that broader car use in urban centres where mass \\ntransit is insufficiently developed are inevitable. Mass transit services such as metros and buses \\nthat satisfy the public’s needs and are easy to use, or indeed, free of charge, reduce the adverse \\nimpacts of individual transportation. Additionally, the use of more fuel-efficient, low-emission \\nvehicles can improve air quality and contribute to combating UHI (Bennicelli et al., 2019). Unlike \\ncars, public transport modes dictate fairly compact urban development where active travel \\nprevails (Vivre en Ville, 2013). \\nThe development of infrastructure that facilitates cycling or walking is also preferred since active \\ntransportation contributes to reducing anthropogenic heat related to motorized transportation \\nwhile benefiting human health by encouraging physical activity (Scotland, 2008). Indeed, \\nthrough the enhancement of users’ health, savings stemming from healthcare appear to be \\nalmost triple the investment needed to develop such infrastructure (Wang et al., 2004). \\nAccording to Wendel et al. (2008), the design of bicycle lanes and pedestrian precincts warrant \\nspecial attention. To be safe, they should be adapted, by way of an example, to children, the \\nelderly, mobility-impaired individuals, and low-income earners who do not own a private \\nvehicle. Additionally, such developments are ideal sites on which to introduce trees and \\nsustainable stormwater management measures that contribute to mitigate UHI. The presence of \\ntrees along streets encourages greater active mobility, thereby contributing to the creation of a \\ngreenway and allowing travel under tree cover (Beaudoin et al., 2017). However, vegetated \\ninstallations should abide by certain safety regulations, such as ensuring good visibility on-site \\nto avoid creating environments conducive to loitering, vandalism, or crime (Green City \\nPartnerships, 2019). Accordingly, several options are conceivable to promote active \\ntransportation:  \\n• create bicycle lanes or tracks; \\n• propose a bicycle-sharing system;',\n",

In the census metropolitan areas, Gatineau, Montréal, and \\nTrois-Rivières accounted for the highest proportion of households with different types of air \\nconditioners, i.e., 75%, 70%, and 65%, respectively, while this proportion did not exceed 41% in \\nthe other census metropolitan areas (Bustinza, 2021). According to a study conducted among \\nmore than 3 000 respondents from Québec and Ontario, air-conditioning unit ownership \\nappears to be associated with property status with property owners being more likely to own \\none (76%) than tenants (57%) (Laliberté et al., 2016). In Canada, between 1990 and 2015, energy \\nconsumption attributable to space cooling in the commercial and institutional sector increased \\nfrom 30.3 PJ to 55.3 PJ (Natural Resources Canada, undated). Air conditioning in homes and \\nvehicles is rising and has almost become the norm in certain regions. Less energy-consuming, \\nmore sustainable replacement solutions exist to cool indoor air in buildings. Indeed, it is \\npossible to resort to different passive air conditioning techniques to cool a building that was not \\ndesigned to protect itself from very high temperatures.  \\n5.5.3.1 The use of natural ventilation \\nNatural ventilation occurs through air introduction (the movement of outdoor air indoors) and \\nair exfiltration (the movement of indoor air outdoors) (Leclerc et al., 2006). It occurs through \\nopenings and cracks such as windows, doors, ducts, joints, chimneys, and electrical outlets in the \\nbuilding envelope (Panzhauser et al., 1993, cited in Poulin et al., 2016).  \\nThere are two types of natural ventilation, i.e., cross ventilation, and natural draft ventilation or \\nnight ventilation. Cross ventilation occurs when windows and doors situated on opposite walls \\nare opened, which allows air currents to circulate in the rooms. The greater the temperature \\ndifference between the outside and inside air, the greater the optimization of cooling capacity \\n(Leclerc et al., 2006). Wind and wind direction also affect the cooling achieved (Health Canada, \\n2018). During the heatwave in Europe in 2003, it was observed that excess mortality was higher \\nin apartments with a single orientation that did not allow for cross ventilation (Déoux and \\nDéoux, 2004).',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  77 \\nThe natural draft ventilation technique requires fresh, cooler air to enter through openings \\npreferably situated at the bottom of the north façade of the building and allowing hot air to exit \\nthrough an opening situated at the top the building. This temperature differential creates a \\nchimney effect and allows for vertical ventilation and faster air exchanges. In addition to the \\ntemperature differential or local effect, the chimney effect is also related to the difference in \\natmospheric pressure between the bottom and the top (Health Canada, 2018). Such night \\nventilation offers cooling gains solely in places where the outside air is cooler than the inside air \\nduring the night. This technique can thus reduce the indoor air temperature by several degrees \\n(Salomon and Aubert, 2007).  \\nNatural ventilation can make it harder to manage summertime and wintertime relative humidity \\n(Health Canada, 2018). Likewise, in the summer when it is very hot during the day, opening \\nwindows is not indicated except at night when the temperature has fallen. Relying on natural \\nventilation at night can also limit the introduction into the building of external contaminants, \\nwhich are less concentrated during this period (Poulin et al., 2016).  \\nTo promote natural ventilation in a new building, the architect must study the local prevailing \\nwind regime. A building situated at a 45°\\n angle to the wind will allow for optimum high pressure \\nand low pressure that promote ventilation. Devices such as deflectors can also be added to the \\nbuilding to alter the impact of the wind and facilitate ventilation (Liébard and De Herde, 2005). \\nIncreasing the air tightness of buildings can limit the possibility of passive natural ventilation \\nthat is not controlled by the occupants. Similarly, the efficacy of voluntary natural ventilation, \\nwhich individuals control, for example by opening windows, is heavily dependent on the weather \\npatterns and climatic conditions and is thus hard to control. Given natural ventilation’s uncertain \\nnature, it is suggested that it be combined with mechanical ventilation to obtain acceptable air \\nflows year round (Leclerc et al., 2006). \\n5.5.3.2 The use of mechanical ventilation  \\nThe growing air tightness of current dwellings limits natural infiltration of fresh air because of an \\ninsufficient air change rate, especially during heat spells. Strategies that consider mechanical \\nventilation appear to ensure a more uniform ventilation rate compared with natural ventilation \\nalone (Leclerc et al., 2006). Mechanical ventilation requires a system that uses one or more fans \\nto regularly remove foul indoor air from rooms and dilute the contaminants found there by \\nintroducing outside air (Anctil et al., 2021). Experts in the field must conduct the preliminary \\nassessment of the buildings from the standpoint of the elements to be implemented to ensure \\noptimized ventilation, especially according to the building’s use and mode of occupation (Anctil \\net al., 2021). The mechanical ventilation system can limit the introduction of external \\ncontaminants when required by running the recirculation mode and keeping windows closed \\n(Sherman and Matson, 2013, Ilacqua et al., 2015, cited in Gervais et al., 2016). To ensure the',\n",

To this end, the project sought to incorporate good stormwater management \\npractices by means of bioretention and permeable coverings, enhance biodiversity, and provide \\nfor interpretation elements. Reflection was initiated upstream on its redefinition in the urban \\nfabric, its use outside peak times such as during the day, and facilities that would better combat \\nclimate change, especially UHI, and adapt to them.  \\nPhoto credit: Rousseau Lefebvre.

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  87 \\nThe project was carried out to satisfy the community’s needs. Accordingly, from the outset of \\nthe project, the borough encouraged discussions between all the stakeholders to ascertain \\nneeds and adjust before the work began.   \\nDescription of the project  \\nSeveral trees were planted and roughly 20% of the parking lot was outfitted with permeable \\npavers. A planting pit and conventional islands of greenery or in the form of bioretention cells \\nwere also installed to enhance stormwater management and optimize biodiversity. Bioretention-\\nbased islands of greenery allow rainwater to infiltrate by acting as a bioretention pond and \\nstoring surplus water.    \\nTo promote alternative modes of travel that do not rely on fossil energy, a bicycle garage and a \\nsecure pedestrian path have been installed. Moreover, four parking spaces have been equipped \\nwith electric vehicle charging stations.   \\nMaintenance  \\nThe city maintains the parking lot. Except for the first year of planting, the plants require little \\nmaintenance and were selected for this reason. Occasional pruning is sufficient. The permeable \\npavers must be maintained to avoid obstructing the pores since the joints between the pavers \\nallow the water to infiltrate. Nevertheless, even if the joint pores are partly blocked, the pavers \\nhave a high retention capacity (1 ml/h) and are always effective.  \\nSpin-off and co-benefits  \\nThe redevelopment of the Aréna Rodrigue-Gilbert parking lot included enhancements from the \\nstandpoint of greening, biodiversity, stormwater management, and active and alternative \\ntransportation. While no temperature measurements have been conducted since the conclusion \\nof the work, the site has become pleasanter, and the project has beautified the district and \\nenhanced the quality of the living environment. What is more, the permeable covering on part \\nof the parking lot has improved stormwater management since part of the surface water is \\ndirectly retained on site, which reduces the water load in city pipes.   \\nThe project also includes an educational section centred on the installation in the parking lot of \\nthree interpretation panels devoted to stormwater management, biodiversity, and climate \\nchange. Furthermore, part of the parking lot can be temporarily transformed for specific public \\nand sports activities to foster creation and social ties.  \\nThe Conseil régional de l’environnement de Montréal certified the parking lot eco-friendly in \\n2018.  \\n\\uf0e8 Total cost of the project: $1,800,000',\n",

The \\nproject’s objectives focused on heat reduction, better stormwater management and improved \\nair quality, biodiversity, and aestheticism.  \\nDescription of the project  \\nThe Collège de Rosemont’s green roof was covered with a precultivated carpet of sedum, a \\nsucculent. The plants store water in their leaves and act as a retention pond. They also have \\nconsiderable adaptability since they are drought-, disease- and parasite-resistant in addition to \\nacting as a filter by trapping urban dust and pollen.  \\nMaintenance  \\nThe sedum used in the green roof requires little maintenance. Limited weeding and occasional \\nfertilization suffice. While the plant is drought-resistant, the building’s roof is irrigated in periods \\nof sweltering heat to ensure its long-term survival. The college directly performs the \\nmaintenance, which, aside from fertilizer purchases, does not engender any additional costs.  \\nSpinoff and co-benefits  \\nThe plants on the roof act as a rainwater \\nretention pond. Accordingly, less \\nwastewater is discharged into the city’s \\nsewers and the water is cleaner since it is \\nfiltered by the plants on the roof. \\nAdditionally, the green roof reduces heat \\noutside and inside the building and \\nreduces air conditioning costs at the same \\ntime. It also purifies the air by capturing \\nCO\\n2 and promotes biodiversity. The site \\nchosen for this installation is visible from \\nthe college’s glass-paned library and it \\nmakes the users’ living environment pleasanter.  \\nPhoto credit: Toits vertige.

The by-law \\nstipulates that when roofs are rebuilt or new buildings are constructed, if the \\nroof has a slope below 2 units vertically for 12 units horizontally (2:12), it \\nmust necessarily be vegetated, white, or covered with a material with a solar \\nreflectance index of at least 78. To comply with the by-law, all the roofs at \\nthe Collège de Rosemont that had to be renovated became green roofs (5%) \\nor white roofs (80%). Since then, most boroughs have followed suit by \\npromoting white or plant-covered roofs to mitigate UHI.   \\nTo obtain additional information on the new measures, please consult the \\nRèglement d’urbanisme de l’arrondissement Rosemont–La-Petite-Patrie of \\nthe City of Montréal and the Mesures visant la réduction de l’effet d’îlot de \\nchaleur urbain dans Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie on  the Natural Resources \\nCanada website. \\n6.1.3 The École Saint-Pierre schoolyard in Alma  \\nTHE MEASURES TO MITIGATE UHI ADOPTED \\nPlanting trees and plants, urban agriculture, and removal of asphalt \\nContext  \\nThe schoolyard of the École Saint-Pierre in Alma in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region was \\nredeveloped in June 2019. A teacher and a volunteer landscaper, both of whom wished to make \\nthe schoolyard a pleasanter environment, instigated the project. Upstream from the project, they \\nobserved a problem of surface water capture and the presence of a UHI in the schoolyard. \\nMoreover, a temperature imbalance in the building stemming from the orientation of the \\npremises and central heating caused discomfort for students and staff. Indeed, the south-facing \\nclassrooms exposed to the sun could reach more than 30°C starting in March. Opening south-\\nfacing windows did not facilitate the maintenance of a comfortable temperature. South-facing \\nclassrooms remained too hot and north-facing classrooms, too cold.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  90 \\nA schoolyard development plan was designed by volunteers to create the grass-free school of \\nthe future. The school administration and teaching staff approved the project. A crowdfunding \\ncampaign with an initial budget of $30 000 was launched to collect cash donations and \\nmaterials. Residents and local businesses mobilized to support the project, which raised $135 \\n000 and allowed for more extensive plant cover in the initial project and enhanced the quality of \\nthe materials. Since the schoolyard cost roughly $100 000, the surplus was placed in a fund \\ndevoted to training the students and maintenance, if necessary. \\nDescription of the project  \\nThe work began with the removal of 27 000 ft\\n2 of grass. To avoid using herbicide and make the \\nproject as ecological as possible, the grass was removed by using chip wood mulch to smother \\nit. Next, 1 340 trees, shrubs, and hardy perennials were planted to create shade and facilitate \\nbetter surface water management. Plant-free areas were preserved to allow the children to go \\nsliding in the winter. Lastly, 35% of the vegetation cover is a kitchen garden.   \\nA wooded path has replaced nearly 4 000 ft\\n2 of asphalt in the centre of the schoolyard, which \\nhas been surrounded by plants, mainly lilacs, to create intimacy, provide fragrance, and reduce \\nbackground noise.    \\nMaintenance  \\nTrees and shrubs are pruned once a \\nyear in the spring by Grade 5 and \\nGrade 6 student volunteers who have \\nreceived gardening training \\nsupervised by a landscaper. Starting in \\nthe first year, 90 young people \\nparticipated in the training. \\nConsequently, the maintenance of the \\nplants does not engender additional \\ncosts for the school. The training also ensures the continuity of the project and is offered both \\nto students and parents. As well, snow fences are installed in the winter to prevent trampling the \\nplants.  \\nCAREFULLY CHOSEN TREES  \\nTo obtain vegetation cover as quickly as possible, Accolade elms, big, super-\\nfast-growing trees were preferred and planted strategically to help cool the \\npremises.

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  91 \\nOTHE CAREFULLY CHOSEN TREES (CONTINUED) \\nOther factors were also considered in the choice of the trees. For example, \\nbirch was avoided because of its irritating pollen but also because its bark \\npeels, making it very tempting for children to pull the bark. The height of \\nhazel trees makes them accessible to children and they were avoided \\nbecause of nut allergies. Consequently, walnut trees and horse chestnut \\ntrees, whose fruits are less accessible, were planted. Moreover, to reduce the \\nimpact of a possible infestation of a specific species, varied species were \\nchosen. \\nSpin-off and co-benefits  \\nSince the project was completed recently, it is not yet possible to observe the impacts on the \\ntemperature inside the classrooms and in the schoolyard. However, a drop in temperature is \\nanticipated and would thus affect building air conditioning and heating costs. While the trees \\nare still young, it is already possible to observe an improvement from the standpoint of \\nrainwater management during heavy rains. The water no longer pools in the schoolyard. Lastly, \\nthe trees planted capture carbon, purify the air around the school, and beautify the \\nneighbourhood. The removal of the grass has reduced noise engendered by mowing as well as \\nmaintenance costs and GHG emissions.  \\nThe project also included an educational facet since the grass embankments have been replaced \\nby five outdoor classrooms. Granite, wood, and mulch were provided free of charge to make \\nchairs, benches, and tables.  \\nTours of the schoolyard with teachers and students were conducted the first year to familiarize \\nthem with the tree species planted, the attraction of the wooded path and the outdoor \\nclassroom on the embankment, and the schoolyard’s future perspective. Today, the students are \\nimmersed in their new schoolyard and the school’s dynamic has changed. No vandalism or \\ndestruction of plants has been observed. The students have reclaimed the schoolyard and \\nformerly deserted places are now occupied. Previously, all the young people flocked together in \\nthe same places. \\nInvolving the young people and their families has created a connection with the environment. \\nOn the day of the planting, 284 volunteers lent a hand and local businesses were also present to \\noffer lunch and refreshments. What is more, since the conclusion of the project, the schoolyard \\nis much more frequented, thereby created a hub for sharing and exchanges in the community. \\nThe École Saint-Pierre schoolyard is an innovative, unifying project that has enhanced social \\ncohesion in Alma.

However, to limit the project’s carbon balance and reduce air \\nconditioning costs, only the common areas were air conditioned. Additionally, a geothermal air \\nconditioning system was chosen to limit the UHI phenomenon, which standard air conditioning \\noften accelerates. Accordingly, 28 430-foot-deep wells were installed to supply the forced-air air \\nconditioning and heating system. While the system is fairly costly, it reduces heating and air \\nconditioning costs by 50% to 65%, thereby ensuring a prompt return on investment.

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  94 \\nContext \\nIn conjunction with remedial work on its parking lot, the Hôpital de Saint-Eustache, in \\ncollaboration with the Société québécoise des infrastructures and the Centre de santé et de \\nservices sociaux du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes, implemented adaptation solutions to mitigate the \\nimpact of UHI. More specifically, it sought to: \\n• reduce the impact of UHI by installing shaded areas and islands of greenery; \\n• foster water retention by means of the integration of stormwater management strategies and \\nreduce runoff in the municipal network; \\n• promote active transportation by installing facilities to ensure the safety of pedestrians and \\ncyclists. \\nDescription of the project \\nTo meet these objectives, the parking lot was first greened through the addition of trees and the \\nintegration of planting strips between certain parking spaces. Next, roughly 10% of the soil was \\nreplaced with light permeable pavers, thereby fostering water seepage in the soil and reducing \\nheat accumulation. What is more, an open retention pond was built to store water. Lastly, a \\npartly covered, shaded secure pedestrian path and a bicycle shed connected to the bicycle path \\nwere installed. Secure spaces for bicycles and pedestrians were also built, thereby reducing GHG \\nemissions and vehicle use. \\nMaintenance \\nTo ensure the project’s continuity, tree species and hardy perennials that require little \\nmaintenance were preferred. Furthermore, the metal and steel shed is maintenance-free. The \\ncost of maintenance that the hospital carries out has not increased significantly since the design \\nphase.  \\nSpin-off and co-benefits \\nSurface temperature measurements were recorded before and after the completion of the work. \\nThe findings are inconclusive since the measurements were not made in the same weather \\nconditions. Additionally, they were made when the trees were not fully mature, which allowed \\ninsufficient time to elapse to estimate the impacts on heat.

Lastly, it competes with \\nragweed, an allergenic, invasive plant that poses a \\nhealth issue in Québec.  \\nMaintenance \\nThe Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux cleans the roof every year in the \\nspring and the fall. The company that installed the roof also conducts an annual inspection. If a \\ndeficiency is observed during the inspection, the company directly remedies the situation \\nwithout generating additional costs under a contract with a 10-year guarantee.  \\nNo special maintenance is carried out on the landscaped urban meadow and the plantings, \\nexcept for mowing by a landscaper on the pedestrian path. The maintenance does not engender \\nan additional cost for the Institut de réadaptation en déficience physique de Québec in relation \\nto the preliminary project. \\nSpin-off and co-benefits \\nNo temperature measurements have been made since the completion of the project. However, \\nthe rebuilt roof is better insulated than the old one, reducing in principle wintertime heat losses \\nand maintaining coolness in the summer. Air conditioning and heating costs should, therefore, \\ndecrease. Additionally, when they mature, the trees should contribute further to reducing the \\ntemperature both outside and inside the buildings. The site is also pleasanter and more \\nconducive to physical activity. \\nPhoto credit: Milieux de vie en santé. Source: \\nhttps://milieuxdevieensante.org/projet/irdpq/.',\n",

It is, therefore, possible that certain articles of interest as regards \\nmeasures to mitigate UHI were not picked up. \\nFrom the standpoint of the efficacy of measures to mitigate UHI, the absence of an air \\ntemperature measurement standard to analyze the UHI mitigation strategies implemented may \\npose a problem. Indeed, while the air temperature at an elevation 2 m has until now been widely \\nused to measure the intensity of UHI, air temperature measurements taken at different \\nelevations are frequently reported in the literature. Similarly, certain studies report maximum \\ntemperature differences while others indicate instead average temperature differences.  \\nThe scope of thermal performance in buildings is heavily dependent upon the orientation of the \\nwalls, their size, the building’s characteristics, plant species, and the type of substratum. This \\nconsiderable variation in data collection complicates performance comparisons of measures to \\nmitigate UHI. \\nThe objective of this literature review was not to target the costs related to each of the \\nmeasures. Since costs vary inordinately from region to region and from year to year, it will be \\nimportant for readers wishing to implement one or more of the measures described to consult \\nexperts in the region. \\nWhat is more, the authors are neither architects, landscapers, nor engineers and their \\ninterpretation of study findings is their own. \\nLastly, the literature review does not broach the legislative and regulatory tools that can provide \\na framework for the implementation of measures to mitigate UHI, although the authors \\nacknowledge that growing involvement by governments and urban planning officials will \\nfacilitate quicker attainment of the benefits that stem from operational implementation.  \\nCase studies \\nSurface temperature measurements were recorded for only one case study but were not taken \\naccording to generally accepted practices. Since the measurements were not necessarily made \\nunder the same weather conditions before and after the installations, the findings are \\ninconclusive. Additionally, the measurements were made when the trees were not fully mature, \\nwhich allowed insufficient time to elapse to estimate the impacts on heat.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  100 \\n8 CONCLUSION \\nIn numerous urban areas in Québec, the concentration of roads, buildings, and any other \\ninfrastructure built with materials with high heat absorption capacity lead to a UHI effect. The \\nlack of vegetation exacerbates this effect, thereby creating local microclimates separate from \\nthose in the areas in the urban periphery. Impermeable, low-albedo urban materials such as \\nasphalt and certain types of concrete that largely make up cities reduce the possible cooling \\neffect through evaporation and increase the gain from sunlight. Urban morphology, especially \\nthrough the density of built environments and the narrow streets in them can also increase the \\nphenomenon. Moreover, the release of anthropogenic heat in urban environments contributes \\nto UHI, which in turn exacerbates the impact of heatwaves. Because of rising temperatures \\nstemming from climate change, already significant heat stress will worsen in the coming years. \\nClimate change is threatening urban trees because of unprecedented urban growth and new \\npests and emerging diseases. \\nGiven that scientific knowledge concerning the best measures to mitigate UHI to be \\nimplemented is constantly changing, this update of the 2009 publication provides more current \\ninformation concerning the practices adopted and potentially applicable in Québec. Several \\naspects have been enhanced bearing in mind the most recent research. The case studies round \\nout the review by providing concrete examples of the implementation of projects to mitigate \\nUHI to encourage the realization of this type of initiatives and to inspire the stakeholders in the \\nbuilt environment. This literature review is thus a tool to which professionals in public health \\nbranches, property managers in the government health and social services network, and on-site \\ninterveners from non-profit organizations in the municipal sector can refer to contribute to \\nprotecting the health of the most vulnerable populations from the detrimental effects of \\nsweltering heat exacerbated by UHI. \\nThe literature review reveals that different measures reduce the UHI effect and its environmental \\nimpacts on the air, water, and energy demand, and health impacts. While, from the standpoint \\nof thermal comfort, air conditioning is one way of reducing the consequences of heat on \\nvulnerable populations, other measures applicable to buildings can be contemplated to better \\nadapt cities to climate change in the long term. What is more, bearing in mind the specific \\ncontext in which measures to mitigate UHI are implemented, they are acknowledged to be more \\neffective when used in combination to complement each other. \\nUrban greening actively moderates temperatures through the evapotranspiration process and \\npassively by creating shade areas. Large urban parks rank first in terms of distance and the \\nintensity of the cooling effect. Different types of vegetation can be used in a vegetation \\ndensification approach. The benefits that trees afford are combined with those of low vegetation \\nand shrubs. City-wide overall vegetation densification engenders a worthwhile impact on urban \\ncoolness. Trees and shrubs can be planted not only on public spaces to create urban cool',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  101 \\nislands but also bordering streets or building peripheries. What is more, when the building \\nstructure allows, both intensive and extensive planted roofs can be installed. In addition to \\nreducing the UHI effect, green roofs facilitate better stormwater management. Sound building \\nwalls can also be planted, especially through the addition of climbing plants. Energy saving, \\nthermal electric generation, shade, and evapotranspiration characteristics highlight the key role \\nthat green roofs and plant walls play in the overall thermal performance of buildings. Such \\ninitiatives lower the indoor temperature of buildings by means of the insulation that vegetation \\nprovides, which keeps heat outside in the summer and inside in the winter.  \\nIncreased albedo in cities promotes cooling by reflecting large amounts of solar radiation. The \\nsurface temperature of reflective surfaces is thus lower than that of conventional coverings and \\nthey release less heat at night. Both the roofs and walls of buildings and road infrastructure or \\nground coverings can be adapted, thereby reducing the surface temperature but also the indoor \\ntemperature of dwelling units. This benefit is all the more appreciable in dwelling units situated \\nin central neighbourhoods that are subject to intense heat because of the density of \\nconstruction. Likewise, the populations living there are often more vulnerable because of \\nreduced adaptability. Dwellings and commercial enterprises can also be adapted with different \\ntypes of sunshades to limit the entry of sunlight and the accumulation of heat in buildings. \\nBlue spaces can simultaneously provide cooling due to evaporation or heat because of thermal \\ninertia, in addition to producing water vapour that causes thermal discomfort in some instances. \\nThe influence of the geometry and the diversity of urban blue spaces requires more extensive \\nresearch. While circulating water has a more significant cooling effect than stagnant water, water \\ndispersed as it is by a fountain has the greatest cooling effect. Cooling facilities in cities also \\nprovide coolness for residents. \\nLimiting soil sealing enhances stormwater management from both a qualitative and a \\nquantitative standpoint. By reducing runoff, the water that infiltrates soil can cool the ambient \\nair by evaporation. Various options can be used, such as rain gardens, inception trenches, \\nretention ponds, or infiltration wells. The use of permeable materials and planting vegetation \\nwill also contribute to reducing the UHI effect by means of their potential to retain water. \\nIt is also essential to consider challenges related to urban heat in architecture and urban \\nplanning on a scale ranging from individual buildings to entire cities, especially by initiating \\nreflection aimed at transforming urban areas to make them denser and enable residents to \\nprefer public and active transportation. Likewise certain changes to consumption habits can be \\nencouraged to emphasize low-heat, low-energy electronic and electric devices, as well as how \\nthe devices are used.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  102 \\nIn the realm of public health, the UHI effect can be measured in terms of public health impacts. \\nFor 20 years, each year has witnessed its share of heat records and projections tend to show that \\nthe situation is not improving. Heat waves in recent years have revealed the full impact of UHI \\non hospitalizations, ambulance transportation, and mortality. The populations that are most \\nvulnerable to heat do not always have the physical, mental, financial or social capacity to adapt \\nto high-heat days. Indeed, while certain characteristics such as age and health status define the \\nstrata of the population most sensitive to heat, their exposure, e.g., living in a UHI, and their \\nadaptability, e.g., by living in an air conditioned dwelling unit, also determine their vulnerability \\nin sweltering heat. Accordingly, a 65-year-old whose residence in a green neighbourhood has air \\nconditioning will be much less vulnerable than a 50-year-old living in an overheated dwelling in \\na highly mineralized central district. This state of affairs emphasizes the need for municipalities \\nto be cognizant of their territory and population to adopt strategies to mitigate UHI in districts \\nwhere the positive impact on the health of the population will be felt most rapidly. To ensure \\nthat the choices made are sustainable and are socially acceptable, they must be made in \\ncollaboration with professionals such as architects, engineers, urban planners, and landscapers \\naccording to each specific situation, together with community-based organizations and with \\npublic support. Reflection must also consider the question of infrastructure maintenance to \\nensure optimal quality, efficacy, and lifespan. \\nThis review reveals the broad range of measures that can be adopted and the multidisciplinary \\nnature of the fight again UHI. Its authors do not claim that it is exhaustive. To this end, the \\nsystematic reviews targeted for each category could be developed, including research on the \\nreal costs of implementing these measures in Québec and the economic value of the co-benefits \\nthat the initiatives engender. Indeed, the economic question is a factor that warrants more \\nspecific research since it is both a lever and a damper as regards the implementation of such \\nmeasures. This review also leads to reflection on the need to break down existing walls between \\ngovernment organizations and broaden opportunities for exchanges between different \\nprofessionals to promote the sharing of knowledge and experience. Adapting cities and \\nbuildings to curtail the UHI effect is essential from a public health standpoint and engenders \\nnumerous health, social, environmental, and economic co-benefits. The transformation of \\nQuébec cities can be accelerated through the collaboration of a vast network of stakeholders.',\n",

       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  126 \\nAPPENDIX 1 LITERATURE SEARCH STRATEGY \\nThis literature review sought to compile a list of the main measures to mitigate urban heat \\nislands (UHI) potentially applicable in the Québec context. It comprises publications from the \\nscientific literature and from grey literature. A literature search strategy was devised with the \\nassistance of an INSPQ librarian. \\nThe scientific literature  \\nSix databases were queried on July 6, 2020 as regards the scientific literature: Embase, Global \\nHealth (through the Ovid research platform) and Medline, Environment Complete, Health Policy \\nReference Center (through the EBSCO platform, and ScienceDirect. The search was launched to \\npinpoint articles written in English or French between 2009 and 2020 focusing on measures to \\ncombat UHI applicable in the Québec context. No restriction on geographic scope was applied \\nwhen the search was launched.  \\nThe search terms used to pinpoint the relevant articles referred to the two key concepts of the \\npurpose of the literature search, i.e., UHI (concept 1) and measures to mitigate UHI (concept 2). \\nA list of terms (keywords) was elaborated for each concept both in an uncontrolled vocabulary \\n(natural language) and a controlled vocabulary (descriptors drawn from a thesaurus) et \\ncombined using Boolean operators (AND, OR) and proximity operators (ADJn). The keywords \\nwere sought in titles, summaries, and keywords determined by the articles’ authors. Tables A1 to \\nA6 present the database consultation algorithms. \\nThe 4 487 articles were located following a literature search in the scientific literature. Once \\nduplications (985 articles) were eliminated, 3 502 articles were evaluated in two stages based on \\ninclusion and exclusion criteria.   \\nFirst, for an article to be selected, the title or the summary had to deal with UHI and minimally \\nmention at least one measure to mitigate UHI. Articles focusing on the effects of UHI on human \\nor animal health were excluded. Following this initial evaluation, 1 003 articles were deemed \\nadmissible. Of this number, 35 literature reviews and 968 original articles were selected.  \\nSecond, the articles deemed admissible were read in their entirety. Among the 35 literature \\nreviews pinpointed, nine were excluded since they did not mainly focus on measures to mitigate \\nUHI. Seven reviews were not selected because they focused on technological development and \\ndid not broach the link or efficacy from the standpoint of reducing UHI. One other review was \\nexcluded since it dealt with the elaboration of a protocol to enhance systematic reviews related \\nto greening and human health and did not mention measures to combat UHI. Lastly, one review \\nwas excluded because it focused on the health impacts of UHI. Accordingly, 23 literature reviews \\nwere selected since they examined UHI and minimally mentioned one measure to mitigate UHI.',\n",
       " 'Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies: 2021 Update \\nInstitut national de santé publique du Québec  \\uf8e6  127 \\nGiven the significant number of original articles (n = 968) selected following the initial \\nevaluation, it was agreed with an INSPQ librarian to evaluate the 23 literature reviews selected to \\ndetermine the review deemed to be of the best quality and conduct an additional search \\nthrough the original articles to round out the missing years according to the review’s publication \\ndate (see the review evaluation process in Appendix 2). Following the evaluation of the reviews, \\nthe original articles published starting in 2017, i.e., the year of the review deemed to be of the \\nbest quality, were read in their entirety. \\nAmong the 968 original articles deemed admissible in the wake of the initial evaluation based \\non the title and the summary, 503 articles corresponded to the period from 2017 to 2020. For \\nthe second selection, the articles in respect of which the climate context differed from that of \\nQuébec (non-temperate) (n = 180), those that did not focus on measures to mitigate UHI \\n(n = 87), and those focused primarily on the health-related impacts of UHI (n = 10), were \\nexcluded. All told, 208 original articles that mainly examined the question of measures to \\ncombat UHI applicable in the Québec context were selected for the purposes of the project. Of \\nthis number, only the original articles that presented elements not discovered beforehand in the \\nliterature reviews were selected (n = 32). \\nAll told, 55 studies (23 literature reviews and 32 original articles) were selected for the project. \\nThe grey literature  \\nThe literature search also included grey literature sources, which were used to round out the \\ninformation concerning the efficacy of the measures to mitigate UHI and update the data \\noverall. The Google and Google Scholar search engines and certain government websites of \\ninterest such as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the United States Environmental \\nProtection Agency, the Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements \\nclimatiques were queried. The search terms were essentially the same ones as those used to \\npinpoint articles from the scientific literature. English and French keywords were associated with \\nthese concepts. Quotation marks were applied when the term to be searched was made up of \\nmore than one word, e.g., “urban heat.” This approach allowed for precise searches for keywords \\nin quotation marks.  \\nSearches were then elaborated in French and in English by applying the codes to refine the \\nsearch. For example, “intitle” facilitated searches solely in the title of Google search results. To \\navoid repeatedly consulting the same result, the search terms for a given concept were linked \\nwith the Boolean operator “OR.” The operator “AND” was represented by a space between the \\ndifferent concepts.

Each of the two sections \\naccounted for 50% of the score attributed to the reviews and encompassed the criteria to which \\na rating was ascribed: \\n• a score of 2 was attributed when the review perfectly satisfied the criterion; \\n• a score of 1 was attributed when the review partially satisfied the criterion; \\n• a score of 0 was attributed when the review hardly satisfied or did not satisfy the criterion. \\nThe section focusing on the matching of the reviews with the topic hinged on three criteria, i.e., \\nrelevance, the completeness of the measures to mitigate UHI, and the geographic area studied. \\nTo accord greater weight to certain criteria deemed more important in this section, the 50% was \\nnot distributed uniformly. \\nThe section focusing on methodological quality hinged on five criteria, i.e., the number of \\nauthors who collaborated on the article, the level of detail of the research plan, the research \\nstrategy, the heterogeneity of the findings, and the disclosure of conflicts of interest. \\nA research professional and a trainee independently assessed the literature reviews. Discussions \\nwere held when differences arose concerning the attribution of a score in order to achieve a \\nconsensus. Tables B2 to B24 present the entire array of scores stemming from the evaluation of \\nthe 23 literature reviews. Three literature reviews obtained a score of 1.4 out of 2, the highest \\nscore resulting from the evaluation process of the reviews: Yu et al., 2020 (Table B23), Gago et \\nal., 2013 (Table B11), and Filho et al., 2017 (Table B9). Since Yu et al., 2020 and Gago et al., 2013 \\ndealt mainly with a single measure to mitigate UHI, it was agreed to select the year 2017, which \\nis associated with the review by Filho et al. that covered several measures to mitigate UHI.',\n",

       " 'Initially observed and documented in the 1800s, urban areas are warmer relative to their\\nrural surroundings [2]. This phenomenon is referred to as the canopy urban hat island (UHI)\\nand processes explaining the unique local climate of cities have been well documented [3,4].\\nMaterials used in cities have low reflectance, are good thermal conductors and have greater\\nheat storage capacity, so they are more efficient than the natural materials at absorbing atmo-\\nspheric radiation fluxes and heat, which is then released at night mainly through sensible heat\\nflux. Urban surfaces are mostly impervious, which alters the water budget by reducing infiltra-\\ntion and evaporation, and by increasing surface runoff. As a result, there is little water available\\nfor evaporative cooling and most turbulent heat exchanges are channelled through sensible\\nheat fluxes. In addition, city landscapes are often less vegetated than rural areas, reducing\\nevapotranspiration from plants and its effect on temperature. Urban geometry accentuates\\nthese effects by trapping energy because solar radiation is reflected multiple times by urban\\nsurfaces and thus the probability for it to be absorbed by the city fabric is larger [5]. Urban\\nareas reduce the wind, which enhances the heat trapping in the city [5,6]. Anthropogenic heat\\nsources (i.e. road traffic, industry, heating and air-conditioning) and atmospheric pollution\\nalso contribute to increasing the intensity of the urban heat island [5].\\nUrban planners tend to adopt many different strategies to reduce the strength of the UHI\\nand its potential effects on the increasing urban population. Common mitigation strategies\\nare, for example, adding green infrastructures such as green roofs, parks and trees [7–10], and\\nincreasing the reflectivity of urban surfaces [10–14]. Replacing urban surfaces with vegetation\\nlowers air temperature due to increased evapotranspiration and less surface warming during\\nthe day. Furthermore, low vegetation might enhance heat release at night since it often has a\\nhigh sky-view factor. On the other hand, vegetation also adds water vapor to the air, potentially\\ndecreasing human comfort on local population. Studies show that in general heat stress is typi-\\ncally lowered when vegetation is added [8,15], which is beneficial to urban population. The\\ntype of vegetation (i.e. low or high vegetation) added and its placement inside the urban can-\\nyon can have a different effect on thermal comfort, for example, trees offer shade and interact\\nwith radiation and are more effective than grass in improving comfort [7]. Increasing urban\\nsurface albedo decreases daytime air temperature due to higher reflection of solar radiation\\nthat causes less surface warming. Nighttime impacts of albedo change seem instead to be negli-\\ngible [10,11,14]. For this mitigation strategy, the impact on human comfort can vary depend-\\ning on the way it is assessed. Recent studies have shown that increasing the ground-level\\nalbedo may well decrease pedestrian comfort due to increased reflection [14,16,17]. The effec-\\ntiveness of these strategies is also greatly affected by the geographical location, size, and com-\\nposition of the city.\\nIn the last decade, it has also been shown that urban areas can have a sizeable impact on\\nprecipitation. Observational and modeling studies in mostly North American and Asian mega-\\ncities reviewed by Liu & Niyogi show a rainfall enhancement of 16% over and 18% downwind\\nof the city (20–50 km from the city center) [18]. Our understanding on the urban processes\\nthat modify rainfall is still evolving because precipitation is influenced by many factors from\\nlarge-scale synoptic systems to local cloud microphysics. The main mechanisms through\\nwhich urban areas can influence precipitation are the following, in no particular order of\\nimportance:\\n• An increase in low-level convergence due to increased roughness of cities which impacts\\nconvection over the urban areas [19];\\n• Higher temperatures over cities due to the UHI tend to destabilize atmosphere, therefore\\ncreate UHI-generated convective clouds [5,20,21];\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 2 / 25\\nsupercomp uter facilities at Environm ent and\\nClimate Change Canada.\\nCompeting interests : The authors have declared\\nthat no competing interests exist.',\n",
       " '• Enhanced concentration of atmospheric aerosols over cities due to pollution are sources of\\ncloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and influence the radiative transfer between the cloud\\nlayer and the surface. These effects are summarized in [22];\\n• Storms tend to either bifurcate around cities [19] or split into small convective cells upwind\\nfrom the city [23].\\nThese processes are not always represented correctly in numerical studies, thus could\\nexplain the differences with observational studies reported in [18]. Nevertheless, numerical\\nexperiments have become more and more important to understand interactions between the\\ncities and the atmosphere as different urban processes can be isolated to disentangle their rela-\\ntive impact on local climate.\\nIn this study, numerical weather prediction (NWP) case studies in the Montreal (Canada)\\nregion are explored. During summertime, important UHI both night and daytime can be\\nobserved in Montreal. While the impact of this city on temperature and heat stress has been\\npreviously investigated [24,25], few studies have hitherto explored the impact of Montreal\\nUHI on summertime precipitation. Located in the Saint-Laurence River, Montreal has been\\naffected by significant flooding events. For example, springtime flooding in the Great Montreal\\nregion is typically linked to rainfall associated with extended thaw periods, hence leading to\\nrapid melting of winter snowpack [26]. In July 1987, a series of strong thunderstorms that\\ncrossed the island in the afternoon generated significant downpours, which paralyzed the city.\\nThis event followed a significant heat wave over the region, which likely intensified the storm.\\nSince previous studies have shown an enhancement of rainfall over urban areas and given that\\nurbanized areas are growing, flooding events are more likely to occur in the future [27]. More-\\nover, impervious surfaces in cities intensify surface runoff and reduces water infiltration,\\nwhich increases the flooding frequency [28]. Additional factors beyond the urban environment\\nmay produce an intensification of extreme events, for instance higher temperatures due to cli-\\nmate change increases the atmosphere’s water-holding capacity [29]. Studies have indeed\\nshown a higher number of flooding events due to increasing urbanization and climate change\\n[28,30,31], which urges cities to adapt.\\nThe main objectives of this paper are, to understand how the urban environment of Mon-\\ntreal influences local temperature and human comfort during heat waves and to evaluate the\\nimpact of the city on rainfall following these heat waves. To achieve this, two heat events imme-\\ndiately followed by intense precipitation are studied using a high-resolution numerical model.\\nFurthermore, different mitigation scenarios replicating urban design strategies are investigated\\nto assess their effectiveness on improving comfort. The manuscript is divided as follows: section\\n2 presents the models used and the experimental design; section 3 shows the results from two\\ndifferent case studies; section 4 summarizes and discusses the key findings of this study.\\n2 Methodology\\n2.1 NWP models and system\\nThe NWP experiments are conducted at a 250-m horizontal grid spacing.

       " '[34,35]. For built-up surfaces, the surface processes are represented with the Town Energy Bal-\\nance (TEB) scheme [36,37]. The urban surface uses a canyon representation [38], which is a\\nsingle road surrounded by buildings (walls and roofs) on each side. Interactions between sur-\\nfaces such as shadowing and radiation trapping are considered by TEB and three distinct\\nenergy budgets are calculated–one for each surface. For water bodies, the surface temperature\\nprovided by the operational analysis is considered constant throughout the experiment, given\\nwater high heat capacity.\\nAncillary data needed as input for TEB are computed directly on the model grid cell based\\non the methodology of Leroyer et al.

The most important underlying vectorial dataset are Canvec and Circa-2000 (from\\nNatural Resources Canada) NRCan databases and the Circa-2000 for vegetation and precise\\nbuilding heights and footprints for the downtown area (City of Montreal office). Morphologi-\\ncal parameters including aerodynamical roughness are computed at the model grid resolution\\n[40]. Cloud and precipitation processes occurring at sub-grid scales are represented using four\\ndifferent schemes in GEM: a boundary layer clouds scheme, shallow and deep convection\\nschemes and cloud microphysics. In this study, deep convection is considered explicitly\\nresolved because the forecasts are done on a subkilometer grid and therefore the deep convec-\\ntion scheme is not activated. For boundary layer clouds and shallow convection, MoisTKE and\\nKuo Transient implicit schemes are activated. This configuration is further detailed in [41].\\nFinally, a two-moment version of the bulk microphysical scheme MY2 is used to represent the\\ngrid-scale processes [42].\\nA similar setup has been used in many studies from ECCC [39,43]. This NWP system down\\nto 250 m grid-spacing is experimental and was built similarly to the NWP system used for the\\nToronto metropolitan area (Canada) run daily for specific applications. Seasonal objective\\nevaluation revealed a good representation of summertime afternoon convective precipitation\\n[39]. At this scale, part of the turbulence is resolved and the thermal plumes in the mixed\\nboundary-layer–eddies of the size of 1000–1500 m and more might be resolved [44]. The\\nremaining sub-grid scale turbulent component, corresponding to smaller eddies, is computed\\nthrough a vertical diffusion scheme for which a reduction of the maximum mixing length in\\nneutral conditions from 200 m to 57 m has been applied [45].\\n2.2 Data for observations and analysis\\nData from operational ECCC surface stations is used to evaluate the experiments. Hourly\\nobservations for surface variables are available for a few stations in the domain of interest\\n(Fig 1, black dots). These stations are used to validate surface air temperature and humidity, as\\nwell as the timing and rainfall rate. More stations are available with daily observations (Fig 1,\\ngray dots), which are used to compare total precipitation accumulations from our experiments.\\nThe complete list of stations with their description is available in the supporting materials\\n(S1 Table).\\nDue to precise representation of the elevation in the model and to moderate slopes in the\\nregion, elevation difference between model and in situ stations was found to be less than 10 m\\nand is neglected in this study. In addition, 2-m temperature is computed above the road in the\\nstreet directly and the reference level is not impacted by the large buildings in downtown.\\nAnother dataset used for validation is the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) dataset.\\nThe version used in this study is the High-Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis\\n(CaPA-HRDPA), which uses a background field from the HRDPS forecasts and observations\\nfrom surface stations and radars [46]. 6-h accumulated precipitation at 2.5-km resolution is\\navailable for the two studied periods.\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 5 / 25',\n",

In order to account for model internal variability, a 9-member\\nensemble is formed for each event as sketched in S1 Fig. Each member uses the same driving\\ndata from HRDPS forecasts (based on 12 to 24 hours lead-time forecasts), but has a different\\ninitialization date, each separated by 12 hours.

       " 'conditions from the HRDPS forecasts. The last initialized member starts at least 12 h before\\nthe precipitation event to let the model spin-up. These first forecasted 12 h are not considered\\nin our results analysis.\\nInitial surface conditions for ISBA are produced from the Canadian Land Data Assimila-\\ntion System (CaLDAS) downscaled from 2.5 km to 1 km and 250 m and for water bodies from\\nECCC’s analysis. Temperature of the urban surfaces in TEB in contact with the atmosphere is\\nconsidered the same as the surrounding air temperature at the time of the initialization (sur-\\nface layer for roads and walls, and first atmospheric level for roofs). Temperature in the deepest\\nlayer of road is assumed similar to the soil temperature from ISBA. In addition, a 12-hours\\nspin-up time is considered for the surface temperatures to adjust.\\n2.3.2 Sensitivity experiments. Four sensitivity experiments are carried out on both the\\n250-m and 1-km grid for each ensemble member: a control simulation (CTL) using the default\\nland use (as depicted in Fig 1), an experiment without any urban areas (NOURB), a simulation\\nin which the albedo of the urban surfaces is increased (ALB) and another one in which urban\\nvegetation is enhanced (VEG). In the CTL simulation, the urban surface is represented by\\nusing a database of rasterized maps of detailed urban and natural classes at a 5-m resolution,\\nfollowing the method used in Leroyer et al. [39] for Toronto. In the NOURB experiment,\\nevery urban surface (roads and roofs) is replaced by low vegetation and the TEB scheme is\\ndeactivated. In the ALB simulation, the albedo of roads, walls and roofs is modified over 85%\\nof the grid points on the island of Montreal. Road, roof and building wall albedo are increased\\nfrom 0.20, 0.15 and 0.25 to 0.45, 0.65 and 0.60 respectively. Other city properties (i.e. geometry,\\ncomposition and materials) are not modified in the ALB experiment.\\nIn VEG, we replace half of the roads on each grid point with low vegetation if the original\\nroad fraction is between 0.2 and 0.5. An important thing to note on the operation of the TEB\\nscheme is its separation of urban land use from natural cover. Both are considered completely\\nseparated–TEB will calculate variables (i.e. air temperature, humidity and winds) inside the\\ncanyon, the ISBA scheme will calculate these variables over vegetation, and weighted average\\nis done for the whole grid point afterwards. To keep the city’s geometry fixed, the building\\naspect ratio is kept the same. In other words, the surface description used by TEB is similar in\\nboth VEG and CTL, but the weight attributed to the ISBA scheme’s results at the time of the\\naggregation will be larger.\\n2.4 Description of the events\\nThis study focuses on two distinct events where surface air temperature values above 30˚C in\\nMontreal were followed by remarkable rainfall.\\nThe first studied period is in July 2018 (Fig 2), when hot days (with temperature values pro-\\ngressively increased up to about 32.5˚C) were followed by a significant rainfall event over the\\nMontreal region associated with a large-scale synoptic system crossing the Montreal Island\\nfrom the southwest. The event occurred during late night/early morning and brought intense\\nprecipitation between 0400 and 0800 local time on the 17\\nth\\nof July 2018 with hourly rainfall\\namounts reaching about 10–15 mm. A complete analysis of this event will be done in the fol-\\nlowing sections.\\nThe second studied period is in July 2019, where a series of hot days with temperature\\nreaching up to 30˚C was followed by intense precipitation in the Montreal region. A squall line\\ntravelled from the northwest and brought heavy rain and thunderstorms in the region during\\nthe late afternoon of the 11\\nth\\nof July 2019 (Fig 3). These systems are typically very unstable and\\ncan be further destabilized as cold and humid air travels through hot and dry air over urban\\nareas.\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 7 / 25',\n",

Other hourly stations analyses are available in the supporting materials.\\nThe model captures well the surface air temperature diurnal cycle during the days prior to\\nthe rain event at different locations in the area. Daily maximum temperatures at the urban sta-\\ntion (McTavish, Fig 4A) for the 3 days leading to the precipitation event are higher by 1–2˚C\\nin the CTL experiment than the observation. Such discrepancy is likely due to the fact that\\nFig 4. Timeseri es of observed and simulated surface variables .

       " 'measurements are done at a single point, usually over low grass or bare soil [47], whereas the\\nmodel computes an average over all urban surfaces in a 250-m radius. Hence, in the model the\\noutput temperatures also include temperatures over urban surfaces, which are warmer than\\nbare soil and vegetation during the day. At the suburban station (St-Hubert Airport, Fig 4B),\\nmaximum temperature is similar in the CTL experiment and the observations. The station is\\nlocated outside the urban area (Fig 1), where the land use is more uniform (i.e. large fields and\\nroads), thus the conditions experienced by the sensor are more representative of the model\\ngrid point average.\\nAt both stations, the temperature from July 14\\nth\\nto the early hours of July 15\\nth\\nof the CTL\\nexperiment differs quite substantially from observations. The forecasted daytime surface air\\ntemperatures are around 2˚C higher and nighttime temperatures around 1–2˚C cooler than\\nobserved temperatures. This indicates a somewhat incorrect model representation of some\\nprocesses, possibly related to cloud cover or inexact representation of the boundary layer. On\\nthe other hand, for the two days leading to the event (July 15\\nth\\nand July 16\\nth\\n) the model cor-\\nrectly captures the surface air temperature diurnal cycle.\\nRegarding surface dew-point temperature, the results from CTL tend to agree with the\\navailable observations but present slight differences (Fig 4C and 4D). In particular, the dew\\npoint model behaviour on July 15 and 16\\nth\\nseems delayed by a few hours compared to observa-\\ntions. No delay is simulated in the air temperature, suggesting that the discrepancy in simulat-\\ning the dew point could be due to a delay in the large-scale moisture advection. During the\\nprecipitation events (on July 17\\nth\\n), modelled surface dew point temperature agrees well with\\nobservations both on timing and value.\\nThe 2019 event shows a similar behavior (results available in the supporting material, S4\\nFig). Air temperature in CTL follows quite closely the observations, although maximum daily\\ntemperatures are overestimated (as explained above). During the morning leading to the pre-\\ncipitation event, the model shows a rise of temperature to up to 30˚C a few hours before the\\nobservations, which we can attribute to clouds that are not simulated in CTL. As for dew point\\ntemperature, the model presents slight differences with the observations throughout the\\nperiod. As for the 2018 event, a delay in the rise of dew point on the day of the event is present\\nin CTL. The ability of the model to represent adequately air temperature and dew point indi-\\ncates an overall good performance in capturing the surface processes.\\n3.1.2 Precipitation in the CTL experiment. The 2018 event is a large-scale system that\\ncrosses the Montreal Island and travels following the St-Laurent River from the southwest to\\nthe northeast. Two accumulation maxima are present in the CaPA analysis on both shores of\\nthe St-Laurence River (Fig 5E). The first maximum on the southeast shore of the river is well\\nreproduced in the CTL experiment, with similar intensities and shape. The second maximum\\nover the island of Montreal and on the northwest shore of the river is less intense in the model\\nrelative to the CaPA analysis. The model strongly underestimates this maximum, as if it was\\nsupressed completely, with less than 20 mm in the 24-hour accumulated precipitation on most\\nof the grid points on the northwestern shore. On the other hand, a strong maximum in the\\nsouthwest of the island is shown in the CTL results, which is absent in the CaPA analysis.\\nHourly accumulations are available at a few stations in the area providing more details on\\nthe evolution of the rainfall event (Fig 5). Considering the system travelling from the southwest\\nto the northeast, we accordingly choose four stations to investigate hourly rainfall intensities\\n(see stations location in Fig 1) as follows: (a) a station upwind southwest of downtown (Sainte-\\nAnne de Bellevue, WYQ), (b) a station in the downtown area (McTavish, WTA), (c) a station\\neast of downtown (St-Hubert Airport, YHU) on the southeast shore of the river, and (d) a sta-\\ntion downwind north of downtown (L’Assomption, WEW). Precipitation is simulated in the\\nCTL experiment at around the same time as the observations, but intensities differ.\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 10 / 25',\n",
       " 'Both the 24-h accumulations and the hourly precipitation seem to indicate a blockage of\\nthe precipitation system before crossing the city. Considering the split of the system on each\\nshore of the river, the cell on the southeast shore is well represented in the model as shown at\\nstation YHU (Fig 5C), but the part passing over the city (defined by the path of stations WVQ,\\nWTA and WEW) seemed blocked before crossing.

       " 'both cells do not merge downwind of the city. This causes the dissipation of the squall line and\\ntherefore there is barely any precipitation downwind from the city (east and southeast of the\\nMontreal island).\\nWe choose four stations according to the propagation direction of the system to investigate\\nhourly rainfall intensities as follows: (a) a station upwind (L’Assomption, WEW), (b) a station\\nin the downtown area (McTavish, WTA), (c) a station southwest of downtown (Pierre-Elliott-\\nTrudeau Airport, YUL), and (d) a station downwind east of downtown (St-Hubert Airport,\\nYHU).

       " 'In both cases, the model seems to overestimate the blocking of the precipitation system\\nbefore the city. In the 2018 event, accumulated precipitation indicated a blockage upwind and\\na possible bifurcation south of the city. In the 2019 event, the squall line seems to dissipate\\nbefore crossing the river. In following sections, we will investigate whether this behavior is due\\nto the presence of the city in the CTL experiment.\\n3.2 Effect on surface air temperature and humidity of mitigation scenarios\\nIn this section, we investigate how the urban land-use/land-cover influences the surface air\\ntemperature, humidity and heat index, by either completely removing the urban area or by\\nusing heat mitigation scenarios.\\n3.2.1 NOURB versus CTL–surface. To quantify the impact of the city, we replace urban\\nareas with vegetation in the NOURB experiment as described in section 2.3.2.\\nAs expected, replacing all urban areas by vegetation significantly reduces surface air tem-\\nperature (Fig 7A), with maximum differences up to 4–5˚C at night. Thermal properties of\\nurban surfaces cause them to warm at faster rates than the surrounding rural areas during the\\nday [41]. They are also more efficient than rural areas in storing heat, which is then released\\ninto the atmosphere during the night. This heat release increases the surface air temperature\\nover urban surfaces, which explains such large temperature anomaly when they are removed\\nin the NOURB experiment. Dew point, on the other hand, is up to 2–4˚C higher in the\\nNOURB run than in the CTL run (Fig 7B), reaching maximum differences during the after-\\nnoon and at night. Such an increase is due to added water vapor from evapotranspiration.\\nThe comfort felt by the city’s inhabitants depends mostly on air temperature and humidity.\\nA way to define this comfort is by calculating a heat index. The U.S. National Weather Service\\n(NWS) algorithm is used in this study [48]. According to this algorithm, we find that heat\\nindex is decreased quite substantially in the NOURB experiment compared to the CTL experi-\\nment (Fig 7C). At night, there is an average decrease of heat index of 2–4˚C, with local peaks\\nof up to 6˚C in the downtown area. During the day, the decrease of heat index is less notice-\\nable, and it is around 1˚C.\\nThe surface landscape and possible wind advection strongly determine the spatial pattern\\nof the heat index, temperature, and humidity anomalies (Fig 8). Denser urban areas show a\\nmore substantial temperature and moisture differences than rural areas, as expected. Although\\nthese modifications are local, the hot and dry air is advected outside the city according to the\\nwind’s direction.\\nThese results show how much the presence of a city like Montreal can modify the environ-\\nmental properties of the city and surrounding areas, making it warmer and drier than the rural\\nregions. The results for the July 2019 event are available in the supporting materials (S4 and S5\\nFig). Intensities of differences between the NOURB and CTL are slightly lower for the 2019\\nevent than the 2018 event. Maximum daily temperatures during the 2019 event (30˚C) are\\nlower than during the 2018 event (32˚C), which indicates proportionality between the strength\\nof the UHI and high temperatures. Our results also show the same diurnal pattern in both the\\n2018 and 2019 events, with the largest differences in heat index at night. Both events show sim-\\nilar advection patterns, however the signal is less clear in 2019 rather than during the 2018\\nevent due to the surface wind that changes direction the day prior to the precipitation event.\\n3.2.2 ALB versus CTL–surface. In the ALB experiment only surface reflectivity is\\nincreased–the city’s geometry, composition and materials are kept as in the CTL simulation,\\ntherefore thermal properties are not modified.\\nSurface air temperature is decreased throughout the whole day in the ALB experiment com-\\npared to the CTL experiment (Fig 7D), but to a lesser degree than in NOURB.

       " 'this decrease is most important during the afternoon when the solar radiation is at its stron-\\ngest. The higher albedo reflects more shortwave radiation in the ALB experiment; therefore,\\nthe lighter urban surface will warm less than the darker CTL surface. On the other hand, night-\\ntime air temperatures in the ALB experiment are only slightly lower than in CTL (less than\\n0.5˚C). This is expected since emissivity and thermal properties of materials were not modi-\\nfied. The white and dark surfaces both release heat at night at similar rates; therefore, the\\nnighttime UHI is not significantly affected by changes in albedo. The slight decrease in tem-\\nperature can be associated with the fact that less heat is stored in the surfaces during the day.\\nThe change in albedo slightly affects moisture (Fig 7E). Dew point is increased up to 1˚C\\nduring the afternoon in the ABL experiment compared to the CTL. Overall, the heat stress is\\nlowered by the increased albedo (Fig 7F), which is in turn beneficial for the population living\\nin the city.\\n3.2.3 VEG versus CTL–surface. In the VEG experiment, parts of the roads are replaced\\nby low vegetation and the city’s geometry is not modified compared to the CTL simulation.\\nConsidering the configuration used in the experiment, the weight attributed to the natural\\nland cover fraction relative to the CTL will be more important in the VEG experiment; how-\\never, the natural land cover fraction is much less dominant in the VEG than in the NOURB\\nexperiment.\\nVegetation has different properties than asphalt and cement roads, in particularly albedo,\\nemissivity, soil moisture evolution through the day and presence of evapotranspiration. There-\\nfore, air is cooler and moister over vegetation than over urban cover. Since the weight attrib-\\nuted to vegetation is larger in the VEG experiment than in the CTL, the overall results show a\\nslight decrease in 2-m air temperature and a slight increase of dew point (Fig 7G and 7H).\\nSome single grid points show the opposite behavior, especially in less dense areas, where the\\nVEG experiment showed higher temperatures and lower dew point than the CTL experiment\\n(S3A–S3C Fig). As those anomalies are isolated and located outside of the main urban core,\\nthe benefits of the scenario are still relevant.\\nThese factors create a mixed effect on heat stress (Fig 7I), with areas that show a slight\\nincrease of comfort and others a slight decrease; in particular, an overall increase of comfort is\\nsimulated in dense urban areas (S3 Fig).\\n3.3 Effect on precipitation of mitigation scenarios\\nThe results presented in section 3.2 indicate the clear impact of the urban land use on tempera-\\nture and humidity at the surface. In this section, we investigate whether this modification of\\nthe surface layer properties (NOURB) can possibly affect rainfall.\\n3.3.1 2018 event. In terms of the effect of Montreal urban area on rainfall during July 2018\\nevent, when the system passes through Montreal at night, our model experiment does not show\\nany significant impact in terms of cumulative amount during 24 hours (Fig 9A). The small dif-\\nferences between NOURB and CTL are just random noise from the ensemble average. As men-\\ntioned in section 3.1.2, the CTL experiment shows less precipitation than observations over the\\ncity and downwind of the city, which we initially surmised to be related to the city’s parametri-\\nsation in the model. However, replacing the urban surfaces and decreasing the roughness in the\\nNOURB run does not seem to change the precipitation pattern. Therefore, the decreased rain-\\nfall over the city area in the CTL experiment cannot be due to the presence of built-up surfaces.\\nIn addition, the surface instability caused by the UHI seems negligible in this case, as the\\nrainfall event is part of a well-organized synoptic scale system. A vertical sounding of the mod-\\nelled atmosphere in the CTL experiment at the start of the event shows very little convective\\navailable potential energy (CAPE) and a large zone of convective inhibition (CIN) at the\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 15 / 25',\n",

       " '3.3.2 2019 event. As opposed to the 2018 event, the July 2019 event is characterized by\\nhigh instability. The front edge of the squall line is typically very unstable, with strong updrafts\\nof moist air and the system travels over the city in the afternoon, when instability is at its maxi-\\nmum. Our results show a displacement of heavy rainfall towards the city in the NOURB simu-\\nlation (Fig 9B) compared to the CTL experiment. Analysis of the composite reflectivity\\ncalculated by the model for the NOURB and CTL experiment shows no visible differences in\\ntiming and propagation of the squall line (Fig 11; the results at 1-km resolution are shown in\\norder to see a larger portion of the squall line). In both cases, the system arrives at the city at\\n1900 local time with strong intensity. Accumulated rainfall differences between the NOURB\\nand the CTL experiment show a signal at approximately the same location as the dissipation\\n(over the city). There is a translation of accumulated rainfall of 10 mm more towards the island\\nof Montreal in the NOURB experiment. In both cases, the squall line loses a lot on intensity\\ndownwind of the city, but it continues with the same propagation direction. This indicates that\\nthe presence of the city seems to affect the system on the upwind side of the island only.\\nThe atmosphere is quite stable right before the passage of the squall line (Fig 10C and 10D).\\nAs the system passes over the island of Montreal, a large area of CAPE is present in the vertical\\nsounding (Fig 10E and 10F). The CTL experiment (Fig 10E) shows a significantly larger CAPE\\narea than the NOURB experiment (Fig 10F) which indicates that the presence of the city has\\nmore potential of enhancing convection. In our case, the squall line splits over the island of\\nMontreal in both the CTL and NOURB experiments, which might explain why there is no sig-\\nnificant effect on precipitation.\\n4 Discussion\\nUsing a 250-m grid spacing for this type of study is interesting for many reasons. First, the sur-\\nface heterogeneity is represented with very high accuracy and precision, therefore local pro-\\ncesses of the urban heat island can be parametrized and resolved.

       " 'experiments at hectometric horizontal resolution are still experimental and further studies are\\nnecessary to strengthen their applicability.\\n4.1 Surface variables\\nThe results presented in the study for 2-m temperature, dew point and thermal comfort agree\\nwith the existing literature. The NOURB experiment, in which all urban areas are replaced by\\nlow vegetation, highlights the intensity of the urban-induced modifications to local microcli-\\nmate. The 2-m air temperature is greatly decreased especially at night, where differences with\\nthe CTL experiment reach 4–5˚C. The simulated anomalies are consistent with the difference\\nin temperature between the urban station (McTavish, WTA) and the rural stations of Mirabel\\n(YMX) to the west and Saint Hubert (YHU) to the east. Available observations show about the\\nsame maximum daily temperature between the urban station and the rural stations, but a 5˚C\\ndifference in minimum temperature. This decrease in temperature is well documented and the\\nurban processes are well understood [5]. The added vegetation also has the effect of adding\\nmoisture in the air due to evapotranspiration, but, overall, the thermal comfort is improved in\\nthe NOURB experiment on average around 2–4˚C, and around 1˚C during the day on average.\\nHowever, a notable spatial variability in the heat index anomalies is simulated over the island\\nof Montreal, with larger differences over dense urban areas (4–6˚C) and negligible effects over\\nexisting large parks. Therefore, mitigating the effect of the UHI will lead to a remarkable\\nincrease in human comfort for the population living in the city.\\nIn our study, we perform two mitigation scenarios, 1) increasing the urban surface’s albedo\\n(ALB) and 2) adding low vegetation at the street level (VEG). The increased albedo experiment\\nshows a reduction of surface air temperature peaking during the afternoon, while nighttime\\ntemperature modification is negligible. According to literature, peak decrease of temperature\\ndue happens when sun radiation is maximal. At night, the air temperature is expected to be\\ndecreased in the ALB experiment compared to CTL, since there is less heating of the surface\\nduring the day [49]. Our results show this behavior, although the difference in temperature\\nreaches almost zero as the end of the night. Our results show a slight increase of moisture dur-\\ning daytime in the ALB experiment, possibly due to an indirect effect on condensation. Over-\\nall, this strategy increases thermal comfort by 0.5–1˚C during the day. There are many ways to\\ncalculate the thermal comfort. In this study, the NWS heat index is used, which takes into con-\\nsideration temperature and humidity. Other comfort indices also consider radiative exchanges\\nat the street-level and winds, and studies have shown that increasing the ground-level albedo\\ntend to decrease pedestrian comfort due to increased reflection [14,16,17]. No detailed analysis\\nof the comfort was conducted as it is outside the scope of this study, therefore results on com-\\nfort changes for the ALB experiment must be interpreted carefully and are more representative\\nof no-ground level albedo change. Further studies on the impact of mitigation scenarios on\\nother comfort indices are necessary.\\nAdding low vegetation at the street level (VEG) in our numerical experiment shows a mar-\\nginal and mixed impact on improving thermal comfort with slight reduced temperature and\\nincreased humidity. However, in dense urban areas, our results do show a decrease in temper-\\nature large enough to improve comfort. Adding trees instead of low vegetation would certainly\\nhave a more positive impact on thermal comfort since they interact directly with radiation by\\nshading the surface [5]. This scenario was not considered, as such effect is not represented in\\nour model. Investigation with other urban schemes in which the effect of trees is accounted for\\nwould provide better insights on mitigation strategies [50]. The results from the mitigation\\nscenarios presented in this paper are in agreement with a similar study done for Montreal’s\\nlocal authorities [51] in which the effect of multiple mitigation scenarios is analyzed.\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 19 / 25',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, Leroyer et al. [51] showed that the small reduction of air temperature (< 0.5˚C)\\nassociate with adding street-level vegetation could be greatly increased with forced soil irriga-\\ntion (around 1˚C). Hence, a combination of increased albedo and vegetation, would be greatly\\nbeneficial for the population living in dense urban areas.\\nFig 11. Model reflectivity for 2019 event.

       " '4.2 Precipitation\\nFor the 2018 event, in which an organized frontal system crossed the city at night, the impact\\non precipitation from the urban land use is not detected in our numerical experiments. The\\nmain reason is probably related to the fact that the UHI induced modification of the air mass\\nabove the city is not large enough to affect a large-scale organized system. These system’s tra-\\njectories and intensity are defined by synoptic factors and a small perturbation at the surface\\nhas likely no impact. Furthermore, even if the signal of the UHI is strongest at night, the atmo-\\nsphere is typically very stable, as compared to during the day, where the surface is very hot and\\ngenerates substantial vertical instability. Nevertheless, Li et al. [20] have shown that in some\\ncases, the UHI impacts on surface variables have a significant effect on atmospheric stability\\nand hence, can enhance rainfall. For this reason, we investigate another event in 2019, charac-\\nterized by large instability as a squall line develops in the afternoon and crosses Montreal from\\nthe northwest. In this case, the city seems to slightly affect the system. Results revealed more\\nrainfall over the city in the CTL experiment compared to the NOURB case. The different spa-\\ntial pattern of accumulated precipitation from the CTL and NOURB experiment shows a sig-\\nnal that indicates a possible impact from the land use: when the city is present the front\\nseemed to be blocked before the island of Montreal before dissolving and there is slightly more\\nprecipitation over the island. The analysis of the vertical profile over the downtown area\\nshowed a large CAPE area at the time of the storm, which is significantly larger in the CTL\\nexperiment than NOURB. This indicates that the UHI can notably increase convection and\\ninstability, and therefore intensify the storm. However, in our experiment the squall line splits\\nand weakens before passing over the city, which may explain why there is no significant differ-\\nences on precipitation downwind of the city. Nevertheless, our results highlight how the pres-\\nence of a large urban area can affect the vertical stability of the atmosphere, especially during\\nperiods of high instability.\\nSuch impact on precipitation supports the finding of the above-mentioned study by Li et al.\\n[20], suggesting an impact on rainfall of the UHI. However, our study indicates that conclu-\\nsions on modification of precipitation due to urban land-use from isolated case studies have to\\nbe interpreted carefully as rainfall is highly variable and can be associated with different meteo-\\nrological conditions. Therefore, other rainfall events, such as more localized events spurred by\\nthe instability created by the presence of the city itself should be considered to gain a more\\nrobust understanding of the city impacts on precipitation. Furthermore, a model intercompar-\\nison and further investigation on the model configuration and the schemes used for the repre-\\nsentation of physical processes at the surface and in the boundary layer could help shedding\\nlight on model inaccuracy and misrepresentation of the rainfall systems.\\n5 Conclusion\\nThe objective of this study is to determine potential effects of the city of Montreal and the\\nimpact of different urban development strategies on the local climate. At present, studies have\\ninvestigated the UHI in Montreal [24,25] and the possible impact of mitigation scenarios [51];\\nhowever, little is known on the UHI impact on summer rainfall. Numerical experiments with\\na subkilometer (250 m) Numerical Weather Prediction System using GEM as atmospheric\\nmodel and TEB as surface scheme are performed, following recent configurations used for\\nurban studies at ECCC [39].\\nLocal surface climate is in general well represented by our numerical model. Overall, air\\ntemperature and dew-point temperature followed accurately the observations available for the\\nstudied periods with some minor discrepancies. As for precipitation, the model was able to\\nsimulate the rainfall event for both the 2018 and the 2019 events, although presented\\nPLOS CLIM ATE\\nUrban heat island mitigation strategie s and climate in Montreal\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pclm .0000196 June 26, 2023 21 / 25',\n",
       " 'differences with the observations. In both cases, accumulated precipitation was lower over and\\ndownwind of the city, suggesting a possible blockage of the systems by the city.\\nFinally, Montreal has a particular geographical setting since it is an island in a valley and it\\nis known that storms have the tendency to bifurcate or split around Montreal. This might be\\nattributed to the river that modifies low-level divergence, protecting the island from strong\\nstorms [52]. The 2018 event did not show this behavior, but the model simulated a bifurcation\\nof the system in all experiments. Observations as well as the experiments of the 2019 event\\nshowed a split of the squall line, although the model misses the merge of the system over the\\ncity. It may well be that our model overestimates the processes that influence the bifurcation\\nand split. Additional studies of model sensitivity to the river properties (temperature and pres-\\nence) and for other heavy rain events are necessary to shed light on the role of Montreal island\\nin bifurcating or splitting storms.\\nSupporting information\\nS1 Fig. Driving data ensemble.

Although UHI is a global phenomenon, it particularly impacts major \\ncities in India, and there is a need for more research in this field. This review \\ncompares the latest global developments in UHI research with the current \\nresearch in India, highlighting areas where India may lag. The review notes that  \\nthere is a lack of research on UHI in numerical modeling in India, which is \\na limitation. Because of this, finding a solution to UHI and putting it into law \\nrequires more focus and effort. Urgent measures are required to lessen \\nthe effects of UHI in urban areas of India. Parameter outputs such as Land \\nSurface Temperatures (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index \\n(NDVI), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), and Normalized Difference Built-up \\nIndex (NDBI) were also compared with the results of prior research and \\nmodules in the review. Using correlations from three prior studies, the analysis \\ndemonstrated that the temperature deviation approximation was 0.157°C \\nbetter than last year's manuals. Consequently, additional research is needed \\nto address urban heat islands (UHI) in Indian cities, focusing on numerical \\nmodeling. Prompt legislative and policy responses are also necessary.  \\nThe review emphasizes the importance of ongoing research into UHI in \\nIndia and measures to mitigate its effects.\\nCONTACT Anita Yadav \\n  aniyad0402@gmail.com \\n  Department of Environmental Sciences, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh \\nUniversity, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.\\n© 2024 The Author(s).

The growing number of economic  \\nactivities that rely significantly on fossil fuels and \\nthe subsequent rise in global population has \\ncontributed to the phenomenon of urbanization, \\nwhich has recently grown more common on a \\nworldwide scale. The environmental impacts of this \\ntrend toward urbanization are evident in problems \\nsuch as the depletion of freshwater resources and \\nthe release of greenhouse gases (GHGs). 3 When \\nUHI first appears, it is influenced by several factors. \\nThese factors encompass diminished availability \\nof natural sunlight, utilization of highly efficient \\ninsulating materials, surplus heat generated by \\nhuman activities, insufficient evaporation, and \\nrestricted convection. When determining the \\ntemperature in specific areas, various factors \\nincluding sky view factor, land surface type, building \\nventilation, and urban canopy are considered to \\nhave an impact on UHI. 4 The UHI phenomenon \\nhas extended its influence on various cities in \\nIndia, resulting in alterations in weather conditions \\nwithin the surrounding rural regions because of the  \\ngrowing urban population. 5 Understanding and \\naddressing the causes of UHI is essential for  \\nmitigating its detrimental impacts in urban \\nenvironments. Implementing various strategies \\nsuch as urban planning and design interventions, \\ngreen infrastructure, cool roofs, and pavement \\ntechnologies, as well as policies that encourage \\nsustainable urban development can be instrumental \\nin mitigating UHI. Furthermore, adopting renewable \\nenergy sources and incorporating low-carbon urban \\npractices to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) \\nemissions can also significantly minimize UHI \\neffects and foster sustainable urban environments. \\nTo mitigate the effects of UHI across Indian cities \\nand elsewhere, ongoing study, monitoring, and the \\nimplementation of appropriate interventions are \\ncrucial.

Data shows that there \\nare a lot of moving parts when it comes to using \\nremote sensing for UHI studies. Remote sensing, \\nhowever, can provide reliable LST readings, allowing \\nfor the regional characterization of UHI. Africa \\nhas received scant attention from the field of UHI \\nremote sensing, in contrast to Asia, Europe, and the \\nAmericas. One possible way to better understand \\nUHI is to use remote sensing more often.

This will ultimately have \\npositive impacts on both the environment and the \\noverall welfare of urban residents.\\nUHI Definition and Classification\\nWhen urban temperatures persistently rise above \\nthose of surrounding rural areas, this phenomenon \\nis known as the UHI effect. The presence of UHI is \\ncommonly gauged through the UHI Intensity (UHII) \\nindicator, which quantifies the temperature contrast \\nbetween urban and rural areas. Researchers have \\nemployed diverse time frames, spanning from a few \\ndays to several decades, to examine and evaluate \\nthe UHI phenomenon.\\nThere are two primary varieties of UHI AHIs (located \\nin the atmosphere) and SHIs (found on the ground). \\nThe study of SHI primarily relies on thermal satellite \\nimaging, Geographic Information System (GIS), and \\nremote sensing technologies, which aid in detecting \\nchanges in the environment and formulating \\nappropriate strategies. By utilizing GIS data and \\nclimate maps, it is possible to predict future weather \\npatterns. By providing a novel modeling option, \\nthe GIS development has helped decision-makers \\nexplore and design new approaches to a wide variety \\nof waste management problems. Among the most \\nlikely methods to streamline the organizing and \\nhandling of solid waste is using GIS data. Unlike \\nAHI, which is more prevalent during nighttime, SHI \\nis consistently present throughout the day. AHI \\nlevels are measured using fixed weather stations \\nand mobile platforms, and both computational and \\nexperimental investigations are increasingly focused \\non understanding AHI. It can be further divided into \\ntwo subtypes: both BLHIs and CLHIs or boundary- \\nand canopy-layer heat islands. These hot spots \\ndevelop between surfaces of varying roughness and \\nspread downwards to a level below the roof.\\nRoughly 30% of published works concentrate \\nexclusively on AHI (Artificial Heat Island), whereas \\nthe remaining 70% examine LST (Land Surface \\nTemperature) and ST (Surface Temperature), \\nspecifically exploring Surface Heat Island \\nphenomena.

This issue has emerged as a significant \\nconcern in numerous Indian cities due to their \\nrapid urbanization. The extent of urban areas plays \\na direct role in shaping the local climate and its \\nevolution.33 Several factors contribute to the climatic \\ninstability experienced in urban regions, including air \\npollution, the heat generated from human activities \\nlike industrial operations and vehicular emissions, \\nalterations in urban infrastructure, and the overall \\nair quality. Studies carried out in major Indian cities \\nsuch as Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi, and Pune have  \\nrevealed notable rises in temperature. As an example,  \\nthe maximum intensity of the heat island was 2.48 \\ndegrees Celsius higher in the summer than in the \\nwinter in Chennai. Similarly, Bangalore has witnessed \\na temperature increase of approximately 2.5°C over \\nthe last ten years, coinciding with a staggering \\n632% population growth in the metropolitan area \\nbetween 1973 and 2009. In Delhi, the heat island \\neffect reached its peak with a temperature increase \\nof 8.3°C, while the minimum temperature rise was \\nrecorded at 4.7°C. Meanwhile, Pune observed a \\nsignificant rise in LST of 16 degrees Celsius during \\nthe period from 1999 to 2006. The most extreme \\nUHI intensity ever documented worldwide was 12, \\nwhereas, in India, it reached an unprecedented \\ntemperature of 89°C.\\nThe consequences that arise over the long term \\nbecause of UHI formation encompass heightened \\nconsumption of energy and water, air pollution \\nthat contributes to the greenhouse effect, health \\nissues stemming from excessive heat, and the \\ndeterioration of surface water sources like rivers and \\nstreams. To alleviate UHI, several measures can \\nbe undertaken. Tree canopies can be made larger, \\ngreen walls and roofs installed, materials used in \\nconstruction can have more reflectivity (albedo) and \\nlower emissivity, passive cooling methods can be \\nused indoors, and the amount of heat produced by \\nhumans can be reduced. It is essential to formulate \\nand successfully explain policies to the public to \\nproduce an appropriate microclimate within cities, \\nand public outreach and education play a critical \\npart in this process. 34\\nThe majority of UHI research conducted in India \\nhas primarily concentrated on the capital city, Delhi, \\naccounting for nearly 30% of the published studies.  \\nBangalore emerges as the second most extensively \\nstudied city in India regarding UHI investigations.

The use of remote sensing data for \\nthe early detection of SUHIs aids in the discovery \\nof environmental imbalance, the identification of \\nproblems, and the development of solutions. 59 \\nWhen studying the UHI phenomenon, researchers \\noften rely on LST as it serves as a useful indicator \\nof local climatic zones (LCZ). Further applications \\nof LST include studying heat wave-related mortality \\nand public health, locating regions with comparable \\ntopography, built environment, and human activities \\nacross different distances, and characterizing the \\nclimate at a specific location by integrating data from \\nboth stationary and mobile sensors. Researchers  \\nalso look at how cultural and socioeconomic factors \\nplay a role. 60\\nUrban Heat Island Mitigation in Terms of Urban \\nDesign.\\nThe extent to which a city encounters the \\nrepercussions of climate change is contingent upon  \\nits capacity to adapt and mitigate these impacts. \\nIt is widely known that cities possess their distinct \\nclimate, which typically exhibits higher temperatures \\ncompared to the surrounding rural areas. The \\nUrban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon has diverse \\neffects on air quality, water usage, and energy \\nconsumption. To improve outdoor thermal comfort \\nand counteract the heat island effect, several \\nmitigation strategies have been suggested, including \\nshading, highly reflective materials, ventilation, and \\ngreen infrastructure.61 Therefore, incorporating these \\ntactics into current urban planning processes and \\nfuture developments is crucial. Researchers and \\ncity planners will need to assess the city's features \\nand planning resources, with a special focus on \\nthe connections among land cover, land use, and \\nmean surface temperatures, to reach this goal. By \\nthoroughly analyzing these relationships, it becomes \\npossible to formulate initial urban design plans that \\nprioritize climate change adaptation.62\\nOne successful strategy for prevention involves the \\naugmentation of urban vegetation. Apart from serving \\nas a natural shield, trees can regulate the ambient air \\ntemperature of a city by blocking sunlight and impeding \\nits penetration into impermeable surfaces. This \\nnatural process, referred to as evapotranspiration, \\ncan effectively decrease the air temperature \\nby approximately 1.6 to 3.3 degrees Celsius.  \\nFurthermore, the presence of green spaces such \\nas gardens and plant-filled areas assists in curbing \\nthe localized temperature increase by promoting \\nevaporation and subsequent surface cooling.63\\nUrban Geometry\\nThe growth of UHI during nighttime is also influenced \\nby the arrangement of buildings and structures in \\na city, known as urban geometry. Wind direction, \\nenergy absorption, and the capacity of surfaces \\nto emit heat outside in the form of long-wave \\nradiation are all influenced by urban geometry. \\nDue to the presence of neighboring structures, \\nmany urban surfaces and buildings are partially \\nor completely obstructed, creating large thermal \\nmasses that retain heat and make it difficult for it \\nto dissipate. Consequently, temperatures in urban \\nareas, particularly at night, tend to be higher than \\nin rural regions. This persistent heat during the \\nnight can pose a risk to urban populations during \\nheat waves, as the phenomenon of atmospheric \\nheat islands continues to exist. Within the realm \\nof urban geometry, a particular focus is placed on \\nstudying urban canyons, which are narrow roads \\nflanked by tall buildings. Throughout the day, \\nurban canyons can have negative effects. The \\nheight of buildings allows them to cast shadows \\nand provide shade. However, the presence of \\nthese magnificent structures in the canyon also \\ndecreases the overall albedo of the city. Albedo \\nrefers to the net reflectivity of a surface or urban \\ndesign, and a lower albedo can contribute to higher \\ntemperatures in the area. Moreover, buildings and \\nother structures hinder the cooling process of urban  \\ncanyons at night by impeding the flow of heat from \\nthe urban infrastructure. 64 The impacts of UHI \\nare the most visible and extensively documented \\nmanifestation of human-induced climate change. \\nThe characteristics and extent of this phenomenon \\nvary across different locations and periods due \\nto variations in climate and urban design. The \\ncomplexity of the heat island phenomenon is such \\nthat research exploring it can only begin to delve \\ninto its complexities. Several factors contribute to the \\nformation of a heat island, including artificial sources \\nof heat, the layout of urban areas, and the types of\",\n",

The \\nrestricted water permeability of typical pavement \\nmaterials also prevents soil from absorbing water, \\nnullifying evaporation's cooling impact. The best way  \\nto reduce the negative impacts of traditional \\npavements on urban conditions is to make them less \\nheat-absorbing, either by changing their composition \\nor by making water evaporation from their surface \\neasier.\\nCool Pavements\\nOne potential way to decrease the amount of heat \\nabsorbed from external structures, particularly \\npavements, is by employing paving materials that \\npossess higher albedo values. Although the use \\nof cool materials for pavements is comparable to \\nemploying them for building exteriors, the available \\nchoices for pavements are more constrained and \\ntypically rely on asphalt or concrete. The efficiency of \\ncool pavement substances in reflecting radiation from \\nthe sun is diminished when glare from pavements  \\nmust be reduced for pedestrian safety and \\ncomfort. Though they are still in the research and \\ndevelopment phase, some possible solutions to \\nthis problem already exist, such as the creation of \\nnovel materials with low reflectivity in the visible \\nrange of the electromagnetic spectrum and high \\nreflection in the near-infrared range. A common term \\nfor strategies that reduce urban heat island effects \\n(UHI) in pavements is cool pavements, which refer \\nto pavements that are reflective or permeable66 and \\ntypically have a lower surface temperature than more \\ntraditional paving materials like solid pavement. 67\\nWater-Retentive Pavements\\nEngineers have come up with various pavement \\ndesigns to address the issue of excessive heat caused \\nby direct sunlight. These designs employ evaporation \\nto reduce the temperature. The main strategy \\ninvolves using porous paving materials that sit atop \\na sub-layer capable of retaining water. This setup  \\nenables water to pass through the pavement and \\nbe absorbed by the underlying ground. As the water \\nevaporates, it releases water vapor, leading to a \\ncooling effect on the pavement and the surrounding \\natmosphere, countering the heat generated by the \\ntop layer of pavement. 68\\nLandscaping\\nVarious approaches to mitigating urban heat involve \\nmodifying the urban landscape. There is no need to \\nmake changes to individual private properties such \\nas buildings or the existing paving infrastructure. \\nInstead, the urban landscape can make use of extra \\nlandscaping forms.\\nShade Trees\\nTrees can diminish the amount of heat absorbed by \\nsurfaces such as pavements, roads, and building \\nwalls due to the shade they provide with their \\ncanopies. This results in a reduced heat intake \\nfor these horizontal and vertical structures. When \\ntrees are exposed to direct sunshine, they release \\nvaporized water into the atmosphere through a \\nprocess called evapotranspiration, adding to the \\nfeeling of warmth in the surrounding environment.\\nGround Vegetation\\nThe presence of low-level plantings such as grass  \\nlawns can have a local cooling effect. When temperate  \\ngrasslands are abundant, they absorb a significant \\namount of solar radiation, but a substantial portion  \\nof that heat is released as vapor through evapotrans-\\npiration if the land is adequately watered. This \\nprocess helps maintain cooler temperatures in \\nthe surrounding ground and immediate vicinity. \\nHowever, if the soil is dehydrated owing to a lack of \\nirrigation, the area's daytime cooling potential will be \\nreduced because evapotranspiration will be lower, \\ncausing a rise in near-surface temperature.\\nExtensive usage of ground plants in hot and humid \\nareas, at night, might ease pain by elevating relative \\nhumidity levels. Keep in mind that the degree to which  \\nthis has an effect is restricted and varies according \\nto the unique climatic features of the vegetated area.\\nWater Bodies\\nThere are two primary ways in which water might \\nhelp reduce the UHI effect: first, through evaporation \\nwhich cools the air, typically achieved using ponds and\",\n",

The size of \\nwater bodies is important, as larger surfaces have \\na greater ability to absorb heat, thereby aiding \\nin maintaining cooler temperatures in cities. It is \\ncommonly believed that water bodies create a \\nlocalized \"urban cool island\" effect, but the ability to \\nharness and regulate these effects is usually limited \\nto minor interventions. 68\\nResearch Trends in UHI Studies in India\\nUHI is a phenomenon observed in cities worldwide, \\nand its potential to contribute to global climate \\nchange necessitates thorough research. Therefore, \\nunderstanding the variation in UHI severity and \\ntrends over time with macro urbanization features has \\nbecome increasingly crucial. The study specifically  \\nexamined Asian megacities and explored the \\nrelationship between the size of the metropolitan \\narea and the intensity of the urban heat island \\n(UHI) effect during various seasons between \\n1992 and 2012. Time series analysis was utilized \\nto detect any ascending patterns in UHI intensity, \\nwhile comparisons and examinations of different \\ncharacteristics were performed.\\nThe results revealed that the relationship between \\nthe size of urban areas and the severity of the urban \\nheat island (UHI) differs depending on the season. \\nSignificant correlations were observed during \\nthe summer season, whereas less pronounced \\ncorrelations were noted during the winter season for \\nmost cities. Moreover, the association between the \\nsize of urban areas and the intensity of the urban \\nheat island (UHI) seems to be affected by various \\nfactors, including geography, growth direction, and \\neconomic conditions that are unique to each city. \\nThe magnitude of UHI was found to be influenced \\nby the city\\'s size, economy, and population. This \\nstudy represents a significant endeavor in examining \\nthe impact of urban area size on the evolution of \\nUHI intensity, offering valuable insights for future \\nresearch directions. Generally, studies on UHI can be \\nclassified into two categories. Detailed case studies \\nfocus on examining UHI in one or a few cities, while \\nensemble or cross-sectional studies analyze multiple \\ncities to identify underlying similarities or differences. \\nThe availability of remote sensing has facilitated a \\ngrowing body of systematic empirical investigations, \\nenabling researchers to explore these types of \\nstudies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that \\nurbanization contributes to increased UHI intensity \\nover time, suggesting that urban impact can affect \\ncurrent warming trends. 69 Table 3 displays the \\nresearch investigations carried out on the generation \\nof heat islands in India between 2010 and 2018. \\nThese articles suggest that the study of India\\'s UHI \\nphenomenon was initiated during the early 1900s. \\nFigure 6 highlights the specific locations where \\nUHI research has been focused on India.

Although UHI is a global phenomenon, it particularly impacts major \\ncities in India, and there is a need for more research in this field. This review \\ncompares the latest global developments in UHI research with the current \\nresearch in India, highlighting areas where India may lag. The review notes that  \\nthere is a lack of research on UHI in numerical modeling in India, which is \\na limitation. Because of this, finding a solution to UHI and putting it into law \\nrequires more focus and effort. Urgent measures are required to lessen \\nthe effects of UHI in urban areas of India. Parameter outputs such as Land \\nSurface Temperatures (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index \\n(NDVI), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), and Normalized Difference Built-up \\nIndex (NDBI) were also compared with the results of prior research and \\nmodules in the review. Using correlations from three prior studies, the analysis \\ndemonstrated that the temperature deviation approximation was 0.157°C \\nbetter than last year's manuals. Consequently, additional research is needed \\nto address urban heat islands (UHI) in Indian cities, focusing on numerical \\nmodeling. Prompt legislative and policy responses are also necessary.  \\nThe review emphasizes the importance of ongoing research into UHI in \\nIndia and measures to mitigate its effects.\\nCONTACT Anita Yadav \\n  aniyad0402@gmail.com \\n  Department of Environmental Sciences, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh \\nUniversity, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.\\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Various methods, such as objective \\nmeasurements from mobile surveys and weather \\nstation data, as well as numerical modeling, \\nare employed to accurately measure UHI and \\npredict climate changes in cities. Remote sensing \\nevaluations can help city planners and administrators \\nmitigate the issues caused by UHI. Research \\non UHI in India primarily focuses on Delhi and \\nBangalore, with studies examining the sources and \\nimpacts of heat islands. By analyzing parameters \\nsuch as LST, Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), \\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), \\nand Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), \\nthe anticipated future influence of UHI can be \\nestimated. Strategies to reduce UHI effects include \\nincreasing tree canopies, constructing green walls \\nand roofs, improving building material reflectivity and \\nemissivity, implementing passive cooling techniques \\nindoors, and reducing human-made heat sources. \\nOne challenge is the lack of public education and \\nawareness about rising temperatures, so clear \\npolicies need to be formulated and communicated \\nto strike a balance in the urban microclimate.\\nAuthors’ Contribution\\nThe author confirms sole responsibility for the study \\nconception and design, data collection, analysis and \\ninterpretation of results, and manuscript preparation.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe author would like to express her sincere gratitude \\nto “Prof. Jaswant Singh” from the “Department \\nof Environmental Sciences” for their invaluable \\ncontributions to this research paper.
